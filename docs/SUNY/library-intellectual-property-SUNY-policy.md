Re: SUNY’s Copyright Policy

It is reasonable to conclude that under SUNY’s copyright policy copyright to materials produced by faculty/staff to create a distance learning course vests in the faculty/staff and not in the University.

SUNY’s copyright policy was adopted on per Res. No. 59-154, upon the recommendation of a Committee on Patent Policy. There have been no changes to the text of the policy, now set forth as 8 NYCRR §335.29 (Article X1, Title J of the Policies of the Board of Trustees), since original adoption. The report of the Committee indicates an intent to adopt a non-restrictive copyright policy vesting copyright in the author except “in the case of certain Government contracts or where the University has employed personnel to produce a specific work” (Report, p. 2). “Any copyright policy which has as its objective the assignment of profits to the University or a denial of profits to the author would have nothing to do with promoting the functions or good name of the University, and would not be justified “(Report, p. 12). “The University should disclaim any rights or financial interest in copyrights unless the material produced was commissioned specifically by the University; in the latter case the equity of the University and the individuals involved should be arranged at the time of commissioning the work. If such enterprises yield sufficient royalties, it is suggested that the University devote its share of such funds to the further development of scholarly production” (Report, p. 14).

As adopted, the copyright policy provides that “in cases where persons are employed or directed within the scope of their employment to produce specific work subject to copyright the University shall have the right to publish such work without copyright or to copyright it in its own name.” The Report gives no indication of the circumstances to which this sentence applies. The Report merely indicates that in such circumstances, the division of royalties between the University and author should be negotiated before work commences.

The memo dated by Joyce Villa and Wendy Kowalczyk indicates that the SUNY copyright policy generally reserves copyright to faculty and staff. The memo indicates that under the 1909 copyright act, in effect when the University’s copyright policy was adopted, there was a common law academic exception to the work-for-hire rule which otherwise would have vested copyright to faculty materials in the University. The memo indicates that there is uncertainty whether the common law academic exception remains in places subsequent to enactment of the 1976 copyright act. Nonetheless, the memo indicates that “the Taylor Law and University policy operate to allow faculty to retain ownership in course material” (memo, p. 5). This interpretation, which does not distinguish between traditional course materials and those prepared for Distance Learning courses, is further confirmed by statements made in the course of other University-wide initiatives relating to Distance Learning.

For example, the “Report of the University Distance Learning Panel” dated indicates that an agreement designated as “v6.0,” apparently among campuses, faculty and the SUNY Learning Network, vests in the faculty ownership of intellectual property rights in distance learning courses. Statements on the SUNY Learning Network web site, the primary repository of distance learning courses produced by SUNY faculty, also assume ownership of rights in the faculty.

Legal uncertainty remains whether the 1976 copyright act abolished the common-law academic exception to the work-for-hire rule, set forth in 17 USC §201(b), remains. This question is, however, largely “academic” since University policy appears to have been fairly consistently interpreted over the years to give copyright in course materials to the teaching faculty.

The foregoing suggests that if SUNY seeks copyright in distance learning materials created by faculty/staff at the direction of SUNY, the matter should be resolved through labor negotiations and reflected in changes to SUNY’s copyright policy. Such changes required rule-making. Nothing in current policy, however, prevents State-operated campuses from entering into written agreements with faculty members for creation of distance learning courses for extra service payment. These agreements would govern and clarify the rights transferred to the University and those remaining in the faculty member, i.e. the right to make derivative works, the right to update the content of the work, the right to use the work for teaching, scholarship or research, etc. (see CETUS brochure “Ownership of New Works at the University: Unbundling of Rights and the Pursuit of Higher Learning” \[1997\]).
