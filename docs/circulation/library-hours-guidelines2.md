**Procedures for Extended Library Hours**

**11:00 p.m. - 2:00 a.m.**

**Sunday through Thursday, Spring 2003 **

**Library staff during extended hours:**

> • Tom Gray - Information Commons Librarian. Tom will supervise student assistants and UPSA's and is responsible for the security of the building.
>
> • 2 Student Assistants. One student will always be stationed at the front desk. The other student assistant will provide computer, photocopier, and printer assistance in the Reference Room and MicroLab as needed.
>
> • 3 UPSA's. One UPSA will always be stationed at the front desk along with the student assistant. The other two UPSA's will patrol all floors and monitor activity throughout the library.

**Procedures:**

> The front desk is to be continuously staffed between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. to ensure the safety and security of patrons and the building. There will be no exceptions to this rule! If a student assistant or UPSA needs to leave the front desk for any reason, for any length of time, a back-up must be in place. Employment with the library may be jeopardized for leaving the front desk unattended.

**At 9:00 p.m. -**

**Support staff will:**

> • Put stanchions in place to direct incoming patrons to the front desk for check-in. These stanchions are to direct people entering the library through door \#3 to the front check-out desk.
>
> • Turn off the sensor to the middle door (sensor \#2) which will then restrict patrons entering the library to the door leading to the stanchions. We want patrons entering the library after 9:00 p.m. to enter through only one door - the door farthest away from the front check-out desk or the door controlled by sensor \#3.

**Student Assistants will:**

• Ask each incoming patron to produce his/her SUNYCard before entering the library.

• If the patron *does* have a SUNYCard:

> - Swipe the SUNYCard and check for a current patron record in SHERLOCK. If such a record exists, ask the patron to print his/her name and time entered the library on the
>
> 9:00 - 11:00 p.m. check-in sheet provided in the notebook at the front desk. Place a V next to the patron's name to indicate the patron has a valid check-in record and SUNYCard.

• If the incoming patron *does not* have a SUNYCard:

> - The patron must print his/her name and time entered the library on the 9:00 p.m. -
>
> 11:00 p.m. check-in sheet provided in the notebook at the front desk. Place an O next to the patron's name to indicate that the patron does not have a SUNYCard and will not be allowed to remain in the library past 11:00 p.m. Inform the patron that he/she will be required to leave at 11:00 p.m. Between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., student assistants will not deny any patron access to the library. However, the process of signing-in and validating ID cards will be used to ensure the safety of patrons during extended hours.

**At 11:00 pm:**

**Support staff, student assistants, and UPSA's will:**

> • Close the second and third floors of the library as usual. Lock the doors to the Curriculum Lab as this room will not be accessible during extended hours. Support staff are responsible for putting signs and stanchions in place to indicate that the 2nd and 3rd floors of the library are closed, are responsible for turning off the front door sensors (to be done at 9:00 p.m.) and are also responsible for making sure that the stanchions are in place to direct incoming patrons to the front desk. Support staff may leave at 11:15 pm when extended hours staff is in place.

**Student Assistants will:**

> • Beginning at 11:00 p.m., the student assistant at the front desk will ensure that all incoming patrons are directed to the front desk. The student assistant will ask to see each incoming patron's SUNYCard, swipe the card, and check for a valid, current patron record in SHERLOCK. THERE ARE TO BE NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS PROCEDURE.
>
> - If a patron *does* have a SUNYCard and a valid, current patron record, he/she must print name and time entered the library on the 11:00 p.m. - 2:00 a.m. check-in sheet located in the notebook at the front desk. The student assistant will inform each incoming patron that he/she *must sign-out* at the front desk when leaving the building.
>
> - If a patron *does not* have a SUNYCard, he/she will be denied access to the library during extended hours. Student assistants should encourage these patrons to return to the library during regular hours to get a SUNYCard or to have any questions answered.
>
> • Beginning at 11:00 p.m., the second student assistant will patrol the first floor of the library to verify that each person remaining in the library at 11:00 p.m. is a valid Buffalo State faculty, staff member or student. The student assistant will bring with them a clipboard and that day's 9:00 p.m. - 11:00 p.m. sign-in sheet from the notebook at front desk. The student assistant will verify each patron's name with the check-in sheet. Each patron who has a V next to his/her name will be allowed to stay in the library. Each patron with an O next to his/her name will be asked to leave. Each patron who has not yet signed in will be asked to show his/her SUNYCard. The student assistant will swipe this card at the front desk computer to check for a current, valid patron record. If the patron is valid, he/she will be asked to print his/her name and time entered the library on the 11:00 p.m. - 2:00 a.m. sign in sheet located in the appropriate notebook at the front desk. The student assistant will repeat this procedure for each patron not on the original check-in sheet. If a patron cannot produce a SUNYCard or if their record in SHERLOCK is not valid, the student assistant and/or UPSA will politely ask the patron to leave the library.
>
> • Patrons leaving the library between 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. must sign out on the appropriate sheet at the front desk. Patrons who routinely forget to sign out when leaving may be denied entrance to the library during extended hours.
>
> • The student assistant not on duty at the front desk will provide printing, photocopying, and computer assistance to patrons in the library during extended hours.
>
> • The student assistant not on duty at the front desk will record statistics every half hour as indicated in the notebook at the front check-out desk. These statistics will include:
>
> Number of people in:
>
> Reference Room
>
> MicroLab
>
> Lobby
>
> The student assistant will also record number of questions they have answered during those time periods.

**UPSA's will:**

> • Accompany the student assistant at 11:00 p.m. to verify that each patron remaining in the library is a current, valid student, faculty or staff member.

• Maintain a continuous presence at the front desk.

• Patrol all floors of the library and monitor activity in the building.

• Refer all questions, concerns to the librarian on duty.

**At 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m.:**

**UPSA's will:**

• Announce to all remaining patrons that the library will be closing in 30/15 minutes.

**At 1:45 a.m.:**

**UPSA's will:**

• Ensure that all patrons have left the building by 2:00 a.m.

• Lock front doors, secure the building. Escort staff to parking lot if needed.
