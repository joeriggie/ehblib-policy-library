-   The 3M security system

-   The Front Checkout Desk Circulation Staff

-   The University Police Student Assistants (UPSA)

**UPSAs: Their main duties are to “observe, patrol, and report.”**

If the 3M alarm sounds, it is the responsibility of UPSAs to stop patrons and ask to check bags. If patrons refuse or don’t stop, the UPSA is to follow closely and radio for University Police with a description of the patron. University Police will respond to the call and stop the patron. The Head of Circulation has been assured that University Police will respond to a UPSA call.

If the patron stops and opens his/her bag, the UPSA will take the patron to the **Front Checkout Desk**. The library staff member at the desk will then check to see what the problem may be and take care of it.

NOTE: The college bookstore also sensors books, and if they are not de-sensitized, the books will set off the library alarm. The staff member at the Front Checkout Desk can desensitize bookstore books if warranted

When there is no UPSA on duty and the 3M alarm sounds, staff at the Front Checkout Desk will ask the patron to stop and ask to check his/her bag. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should any staff member or student assistant follow the patron.

As long as the Front Checkout Desk is staffed and UPSA’s are on duty, all 3M alarm problems should be handled by them.
