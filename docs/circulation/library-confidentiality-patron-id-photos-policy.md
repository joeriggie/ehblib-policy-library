The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their educational records. A record, within the meaning of the Act, is any information recorded in any way, including, but not limited to, handwriting, print, computer media, video or audiotape, film, microfilm, and microfiche. The Act affords the student the right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s educational records, except to the extent that FERPA authorized disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the college in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position, including law enforcement unit personnel. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an educational record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. *(Excerpted from the *Model Notification of Rights under FERPA for Postsecondary Institutions* distributed by the State Education Department on April 21, 1997)*

Reason for Issuing Procedures
=============================

The University Police, in order to fulfill their professional responsibility, will sometimes require the picture of a student contained in the college’s identification card system managed by the staff of the Butler Library. To insure that the release of students’ pictures are handled as appropriate disclosure exception allowed under FERPA, the procedures below will be followed.

Procedures
==========

The authorization to release a student’s picture from the college’s ID system must be in *writing* and signed by one of the following senior officers within the Buffalo State University Police Department: Chief of University Police, Deputy Chief, or an Investigator. Any request by officers or lieutenants should be directed through the Investigators Office. Under extenuating circumstances, lieutenants may authorize the release of a student’s ID picture but an IDC (Intra-Departmental Correspondence) explaining why it was necessary to obtain the card without going through the investigators must be written and submitted to the Chief of University Police within eight hours. The authorization should be presented to the Head of Circulation Services or, in her absence, a senior member of the library staff and must contain the following information:

> Student’s name
>
> Student’s Social Security Number
>
> Name and Title of the Officer Authorizing the Release
>
> Signature of the Authorizing Officer

The Library staff member releasing the student picture will date and initial the authorization. The Library will keep the authorization on file for seven years.
