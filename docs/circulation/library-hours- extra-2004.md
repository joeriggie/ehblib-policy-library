The library is pleased to host special events. Events held in the library should be scheduled to coincide with the Schedule of Hours published each semester and during the summer. If there is sufficient justification to schedule an event when the library is normally closed to public use, the following guidelines apply.

-   When a *library staff member* is responsible for the arrangements, he or she will

    -   Arrange to open and close the building and specific rooms

    -   Determine whether or not to request the services of a University Police Student Assistant (UPSA) by contacting Donald Agen, Chase Hall 117, 878-6612

    -   Determine whether or not to request custodial services from Campus Services by contacting Paul Murphy, Central Receiving 205, 878-4115

-   When the *Office of Events Management* is responsible for the arrangements, it will

    -   Notify the Office of Library Administration (BL 134, 878-6314)

        -   Library Administration will try to find a library staff member to volunteer to be on duty for the event to unlock and lock the building and rooms and monitor the entrance

        -   If no library staff member will volunteer, Library Administration will notify the Office of Events Management that the event cannot be held as scheduled unless the organizers

            -   Hire a monitor (usually a UPSA who will not have building keys) and

            -   Get the consent of University Police to unlock and lock the building and rooms

    -   Determine whether or not to request custodial services from Campus Services

The objective for these guidelines is to insure the security of the library building and its collections and equipment while accommodating reasonable use of the space.
