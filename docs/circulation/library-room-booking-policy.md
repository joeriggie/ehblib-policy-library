BOOKING ROOMS AND EQUIPMENT

E. H. Butler Library

So that the use of rooms and equipment can be scheduled efficiently and without conflict, bookings will be made in Microsoft Outlook Calendars located in the public folders on the Buffalo State Exchange server. Since all library staff will (eventually) be authorized to view the bookings, entries need to be clear and unambiguous. As far as possible please follow the following format for entering bookings on the calendars:
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

-   Beginning and ending times for the booking

-   Time of event or class if different from period booked, (someone looking at the calendar should be able to tell what time the event or class begins and ends even if set-up and break-down time has been scheduled)

-   Name of event, group that is meeting, or catalog number of class; include call numbers for library classes

<!-- -->

-   Name of person running the event or meeting or the instructor for the class

-   Telephone number for the person running the event or meeting or the instructor for the class (telephone numbers for library staff members are not necessary)

-   Name of library staff member involved, if any

-   Initials of the person making the booking

-   For equipment bookings include the event information
