**USING SUNYCards FOR PHOTOCOPIERS AND NETWORKED LASER PRINTERS**

Beginning Friday, March 10, 2000 faculty, staff and students may use their SUNYCards for the library photocopiers and networked laser printers in Reference and Media Services.

**Students** may add money to their SUNYCards at the Add-Value machines located at the bottom of the staircase in the lower lobby and in the photocopier lounge. Directions are posted on these machines.

Students can still add value to previously purchased vendacards if so desired.

**Faculty and staff** can request $25.00 be added to their SUNYCards at the Circulation Desk.

Faculty and staff may still use their vendacards for photocopying if so desired.

**Guests** wishing to use the photocopiers or networked printers in the library must purchase a vendacard.

**PROCEDURES FOR INITIALIZING STUDENT SUNYCARDS**

**1)** **New SUNYCards** will be initialized at the time they are issued.

**2)** **SUNYCards issued between 01/01/00 and 03/10/00** have not been initialized (about 1000). Students and/or faculty will be unable to use these cards to make photocopies or prints. The error messages on the card readers and/or add-value machines will read either "BAD S/C" or "NO BLANK." These cards must be initialized at the SUNYCard Desk.

**3)** **SUNYCards issued between 01/01/98 and 01/01/00** will work in all photocopiers, printers, card readers and add-value machines. Students however, will need to add money to their card at one of the add-value machines.

**4) SUNYCards issued before 01/01/98** may not have been initialized or may not work at all because the magnetic stripe has been demagnetized. New cards may need to be issued.

Two card-readers are now located in Circulation Services. Card-reader \#1, located at the SUNYCard station will be used to initialize new SUNYCards. Card-reader \#2, also located at the SUNYCard station will be used to add value to faculty/staff SUNYCards and to check the status of student SUNYCards.

**MAKE SURE TO INSERT SUNYCARDS INTO THE INITIALIZER CORRECTLY - FACE UP WITH THE LARGE MAGNETIC STRIPE TO THE LEFT.**

Electronic Services is available to answer questions Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Extra vendacards will be left at the Circulation Desk to pass out to students who have problems adding value to their SUNYCards.

**NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN TO STUDENTS FOR PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED VENDACARDS**
