==================

If law enforcement agents (e.g. Buffalo Police, Federal Bureau of Investigation, US Secret Service, etc.) ask you to provide them with confidential library records:

1.  **Call your supervisor**, the library director, or other responsible administrator from the list below. If they are not available in the library, call their home or cell phone numbers or call University Police (UP).

2.  **The administrator will determine** whether the agents have appropriate court-initiated paperwork (search warrant, subpoena, etc.) and will notify the Office of Finance & Management.

3.  **If there is no paperwork**, the administrator should advise the agents that you are not authorized to release such information without the proper authorization. If there is no administrator available, call UP to support your position.

4.  **If the agent presents paperwork** and the administrator is not available to verify it, call UP to verify it.

5.  **If the agent presents a *subpoena*** that has been verified by an administrator or UP, then:

    -   Accept the document

    -   Inform the agent that the appropriate authority will contact them when the subpoena has been evaluated

    -   Write down the name and telephone number of the agent to contact

6.  **If the agent presents a** ***search warrant*** that has been verified by an administrator or UP, then:

    -   Permit the search to be conducted

    -   Answer specific questions; do not volunteer information

    -   Obtain a receipt for any library property which the agents remove from the premises

7.  **Inform the Directorâ€™s Office** what has happened unless the agent advises you that a gag order applies to the particulars of the search.
