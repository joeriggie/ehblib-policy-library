**Policy on Noise**

E. H. Butler Library

College

In the Spring 2004 Survey students and faculty identified noise as being a major problem in the library. In response to that concern E. H. Butler Library is striving to provide an atmosphere that is comfortable and casual, but above all, conducive to reading, research and study.

> *Library users are expected to be considerate of other users by keeping noise to a minimum.*

*Cell Phones* - The use of cell phones contributes to noise problems in the library. Library users are asked to:

-   Make all calls in the lobby areas of the library.

-   Use the silent signal function as the alert for incoming calls. Patrons who do not have the silent signal function should turn the audible signal to the lowest volume or turn the phone off and let calls go to voice mail while in the library.

-   When a call is received, place the caller on hold and move to the lobby to talk.

*Groups*

-   Students who wish to work together in groups should reserve one of the Group Study Rooms in StudyQuad by going to the Reference Desk or calling 878-6300.

-   Students who wish to work together in groups while eating and drinking should gather in the Lobby, the Copier Lounge, or in BL 129.

-   Students who wish to converse or socialize should gather in the Lobby, the Copier Lounge, the Roof Garden, or in BL 129.

-   Tours of the library are offered by the staff which means that groups will be walking through service areas of the building with a leader describing the resources. Every effort will be made to minimize disruption.

*Individuals*

-   Students looking for a quiet area should go to one of the QuietQuads, the northwest quadrants on the second or third floors.

-   Students with disabilities who require an extraordinarily quiet environment should contact Hilary Sternberg, the Special Services Librarian, at 878-6305 to make arrangements

*Computers* - The Curriculum Materials Lab, Media Services, the Reference Room, and StudyQuad all offer computers for student use. Library staff members assist students with the use of these resources so a certain amount of conversation is to be expected. Computers, keyboards, printers and copiers in these areas also contribute to general background noise

*Service Desks* - One should expect a certain level of noise at service desks where staff must converse with patrons and each other.

*Special Events* - Occasionally a special event is scheduled in the library. There may be some noise or other disruption for the duration of the event.
