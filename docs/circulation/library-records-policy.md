**SUNY Libraries**

**Recommended Library Records Policy**

As state institutions, SUNY libraries' primary obligation is to uphold New York State Law. Section 4509 of New York State Law address confidentiality of patrons' personal library records:

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**New York State Law - §4509. Library records**

"Library records, which contain names or other personally identifying details regarding the users of public, free association, school, college and university libraries and library systems of this state, including but not limited to records related to the circulation of library materials, computer database searches, interlibrary loan transactions, reference queries, requests for photocopies of library materials, title reserve requests, or the use of audio-visual materials, films or records, shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed except that such records may be disclosed to the extent necessary for the proper operation of such library and shall be disclosed upon request or consent of the user or pursuant to subpoena, court order or where otherwise required by statute."

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

No personal information of any kind regarding any patron should be released to anyone by a library of the State University of New York, regardless of the requestor's identity or official status, unless a court order or subpoena is presented and has been verified and authenticated by an attorney of the State University of New York or other appropriate legal counsel. In addition, such records can only be released by “the person in charge of such library, or a designee of such person" (section 2307, New York State Law).

SUNYLA recommends that the Aleph patron id removal utility be used at a minimum of once a week. This enhancement to the Aleph 500 LMS was developed by Ex Libris in response to concerns within SUNY regarding the privacy of patron borrowing records.

SUNYLA also recommends that any library print records which contain patron identifying information, such as Internet sign-up sheets, hold lists, etc., be similarly destroyed or “scrubbed” of identifying information on a weekly basis. In addition, the following patron records should be examined for personally identifying information, and such information should be removed, on a weekly basis:

log files: systems, servers and server proxies, OPAC searches, SFX, ILL programs, virtual reference/chat sessions

transactions: document delivery, interlibrary loan, electronic reserves,

records that support personalized services

search histories saved beyond a session

saved searches and sets

SDI profiles

e-mail message files and logs

public workstations signup sheets

browsers: caches, history files, cookies, certificates, bookmarks/favorites

paper sign-up sheets

licensed services

shared computer systems and servers

back-up tapes (local and off-site)

remote Web sites, including content providers, outsourced Web hosting, proxy servers, etc.

personalization profiles and other service offers for personal information

usage statistics.

signed Internet/e-mail acceptable use agreements

Should a court order or subpoena be presented in a SUNY library at any time, the following procedures are recommended:

> **Student workers** should inform their immediate supervisor. On no occasion are student workers authorized, or obliged, to give library information to anyone not currently employed by the Library.
>
> **Clerical / Professional Staff and Volunteers** should inform the library's director, either in person or by phone. If the Director is unavailable, one of the professional librarians should be informed.
>
> **Directors / Librarians** are encouraged to do the following:
>
> 1. Have the subpoena, court order, or other legal document verified by an attorney of the State University of New York, or an attorney at the ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom (**1-800-545-2433, ext. 4223** -- Inform the staff that you need legal advice).
>
> **IMPORTANT**: Any New York State library has at least **twenty-four hours** to produce legally-requested personal information unless the requesting document is a search warrant, which must be executed immediately.
>
> 2. Release the requested information as specified by section 2307 of New York State Law. Such requested information must be a "full-sized legible reproduction" of the information, and must be "certified as complete and accurate by the person in charge ... or a designee of such person." The person certifying the records does not need to appear in court unless specifically ordered by the court. (see NYS Law, §2307, below)

**New York State Law **

**§2307. Books, papers and other things of a library, department or bureau of a municipal corporation or of the state**

**Issuance by court.** A subpoena duces tecum to be served upon a library…requiring the production of any books, papers or other things, shall be issued by a justice of the supreme court in the district in which the book, paper or other thing is located or by a judge of the court in which an action for which it is required is triable. Unless the court orders otherwise, a motion for such subpoena shall be made on at least one day’s notice to the library…having custody of the book, document or other thing and the adverse party. Such subpoena must be served upon such library…having custody of the book, document or other thing and the adverse party at least twenty-four hours before the time fixed for the production of such records unless in the case of an emergency the court shall by order dispense with such notice otherwise required. Compliance with a subpoena duces tecum may be made by producing a full-sized legible reproduction of the item or items required to be produced certified as complete and accurate by the person in charge of such library, or a designee of such person, and no personal appearance to certify such item or items shall be required of such person or designee, unless the court shall order otherwise pursuant to subdivision (d) of rule 2214 of this chapter. Where a stipulation would serve the same purpose as production of the book, document or other thing and the subpoena is required because the parties will not stipulate, the judge may impose terms on any party, including the cost of production of the book or document, and require such cost to be paid as an additional fee to the library, department or officer.

**Patriot Act**

Provisions specific to the Patriot Act:

-   Gag order – Library staff cannot disclose a request for personal information under the Patriot Act, either to the patron in question or to anyone else (other than necessary library staff).

-   Requests for information under the Patriot Act are search warrants, so all Patriot Act requests must be executed immediately. You can ask for time to verify the document, but a requestor with a search warrant is not required to grant such a request.

-   Section 215 of the Patriot Act ("Access to Records") allows an FBI agent to obtain a search warrant for “any tangible thing”; this includes digital information.

-   Patriot Act requests for any person's personal information can be obtained simply on suspicion of terrorism-related activities; "probable cause" is no longer required.
