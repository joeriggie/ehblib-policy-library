**University Police Student Assistants (UPSA)**

Welcome UPSA…

> Welcome to the E. H. Butler Library at Buffalo State College. The Library Staff is very happy to have you work with us as a UPSA. As one of the campus buildings that is open to patrons outside of Buffalo State, its staff depend greatly upon UPSA to help provide a safe and secure place for its patrons and staff to enjoy. The E. H. Butler Library and the Crime Prevention Office have created this guide to clarify your role in the Library, and help guide you.

How do I get started?

-   At the beginning of each semester, introduce yourself to the Library Staff at the main Circulation Desk. We enjoy meeting the people who will be working with us.

What are my responsibilities?

-   Patrol, Observe and Report

<!-- -->

-   **Inform the Circulation Staff of any incidents that involve or require the assistance of University Police.**

<!-- -->

-   Assist Library staff in addressing emergencies.

-   Ensure the safety of Library patrons and staff by reporting suspicious persons or unsafe conditions to the Circulation Staff and University Police.

-   Protect the Library from theft and vandalism by reporting suspicious activities to the Circulation Staff and University Police.

-   Know the locations of blue light emergency telephones.

-   Wear your issued UPSA uniform at all times when you are on duty.

-   If you are scheduled for a break during your shift, inform the Circulation Staff when you are taking your break and where you will be should an emergency occur.

-   Library policy prohibits staff from eating in the public areas of the Library. Consume your food and beverage in the vending room or staff break room during your scheduled break.

-   Do not allow yourself to be distracted while on duty. Socialize with staff and patrons before your shift begins or after it ends.

What do I do?

> **At the start of your shift…**

-   Sign in in the UPSA book at the front Checkout Desk. This is the only way that the Library Circulation Staff knows that a PSA is on duty, and the Crime Prevention Office knows that you reported to your post.

-   Be sure to inform a Circulation Staff member if you are going to be the only PSA on duty during your shift.

> **During your shift…**

-   **One UPSA posts at the UPSA Station** in the Upper Lobby to monitor the main entrance and exit to the Library.

-   Should a Library patron set-off the exit alarm, ask the patron to show you any Audio/Video Tapes, CD’s, Books, and the like. Make sure that these items either belong to the patron, or have been properly checked-out to the patron. If everything is in order, thank the patron and allow him/her to exit the Library. If you have any questions or concerns about the patron’s items, escort the patron to the Checkout Desk or Main Circulation Desk and speak with a Circulation Staff member.

-   Do not perform any Circulation Services functions, such as checking-out Library materials or accepting Library materials for return.

<!-- -->

-   **One UPSA patrols the Library.** Be sure to check the stairways, staff areas, and restrooms on the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors. Be familiar with all of the little *nooks* and *crevices* in the Library. While you are making your rounds, ***look*** for patrons that may require the assistance of University Police, and report this immediately. Also, look for conditions that are unsafe or may lead to a problem (burned-out light bulbs, water leaks, and the like), and report this to a Circulation Staff member and make note of it on your Library Activity Report.

-   Ask patrons who are eating or have uncovered beverage containers to move to the Upper Lobby or Vending Room where eating and drinking is permitted.

-   Be sure to patrol the Reference room and Curriculum Lab often, especially during evening and weekend shifts when there are few Library Staff on duty. Making yourself highly visible in these areas effectively deters inappropriate behavior.

> **Closing the Library…**

-   UPSA are required to assist the Circulation Staff with closing the Library.

-   One hour before closing time, circulate through the stacks on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors, and inform patrons that these areas will be closing in 30 minutes.

-   35 minutes before closing time, report to the main Circulation desk to escort a Circulation Staff member to CyberQuad. Circulation Staff will close this area. Then, begin closing the stacks starting with the third floor.

-   30 minutes before closing time, circulate through the stacks again and make sure that all patrons have exited. If patrons are still working, tell them that the stacks are closed, and give them time to gather their belongings. When all patrons have exited the area, turn off the lights in that area.

-   30 minutes before closing, inform patrons in the Reference, Microforms, Periodicals, and Copier rooms that these areas will close in 15 minutes.

-   15 minutes before closing time, check these rooms again. If patrons are still working, tell them that the area is closed, and give them time to gather their belongings. When all patrons have exited the area, turn off the lights in that area.

-   Never turn off the lights in the Lower and Upper Lobbies. Circulation Staff will close these areas when they are sure that all patrons have exited and it is safe to do so.

> **At the end of your shift…**

-   Sign out in the UPSA book at the front Checkout Desk.

-   Place a duplicate copy of the Library Activity Report form in the UPSA book.

-   If you are scheduled for the closing shift, you are scheduled to work 15 minutes past closing time, or until the last Circulation Staff member leaves.

-   Exit with the Circulation Staff through the back door of the library, and escort Circulation Staff members to their automobiles if you are asked to do so.

> **Special situations…**

-   From time-to-time, you may be asked to assist the Circulation Staff with unusual circumstances or special requests. These situations usually arise during evening and weekend hours when there are few Library Staff members on duty. Examples include assisting patrons with special needs, special programs scheduled in the Library, and emergencies.

What if…

> **A Patron is uncooperative?**

-   Report the situation to University Police.

-   Remember, your duty is to Patrol, Observe and Report.

> **I have questions?**

-   Always feel free to speak with a Circulation Staff member. Whether you encounter a problem while on duty, are unclear about a Library procedure, or have a concern; a Circulation Staff member is always available.

What is the role of the Circulation Staff?

-   Circulation Services is responsible for the Library building.

-   Circulation Staff are required to follow and enforce Library policy and procedures. Reviews of Library policy and procedures are through the Library Director’s Office. If you disagree with Library policy or procedures, speak with Don Agen – he will appropriately address your concern.
