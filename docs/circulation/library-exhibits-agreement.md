**Please read the following regulations *carefully*:**

**Managing Exhibit:** Exhibits must be identified with a title sign, descriptive labels, and name of exhibitor. Any explanatory card or label must be smaller than 5” X 8” and must be adhered only with rubber cement or artist’s putty. No work of art may be affixed to the wall, paneling, or concrete in any other way. No tape of any kind is allowed. Hanging pieces must be suspended by wire or fishline from *S* hooks. The plants and kiosks in the lobby may not be moved nor may the spotlights be altered. The integrity of the library building must be maintained.

**Installation:** Exhibitors set up and remove their own exhibits and must provide their own materials (hooks, wire, signs, labels, etc.) Installation must take place during regular library hours unless prior arrangements have been made.

**Storage:** The library has no space to store exhibit materials. Materials must be brought on the day of installation and removed on the day of removal.

**Locked Cases:** The library has four lockable cases: three free-standing cases in the lobby and one wall case adjacent to them. None of these cases may be moved.

**Publicity:** The library submits notification of exhibits to the library Web page, campus Web page, and College Relations office which contacts the local news media. Any other notification must be handled by the exhibitor.

**Insurance:** E. H. has no insurance. Exhibitors should be self-insured.

**Cancellation**: Library exhibit spaces are in demand. Please notify us of a cancellation as soon as possible.

**Return this form, completed, signed and dated, to the Exhibits Committee. Upon receipt, it will be reviewed and stamped CONFIRMATION. Until you receive a photocopy of the stamped EXHIBIT AGREEMENT, you cannot consider your exhibit to be confirmed. If questions arise, please call the Exhibits Committee.**

**I agree to the regulations stated above and will display my work in E. H. .**
