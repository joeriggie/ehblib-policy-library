*(Special note: As special as we are, we are not ESSENTIAL SERVICE employees.)*

Should the closing of the library be determined before the start of the work day, staff who elect to work even though the library is closed must follow established campus procedures by reporting to University Police, Chase 110, to sign the Attendance Record/Emergency Conditions sheet and then come to the library to work. No one may work in the building alone for security reasons.
