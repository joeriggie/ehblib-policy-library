***PURPOSE***
=============

> The purpose is to provide guidelines in the event a person becomes trapped or experiences malfunctioning of an elevator.

COMMUNICATION WHEN SOMEONE IS TRAPPED
-------------------------------------

> It is important that communication be maintained between the elevator occupant and the outside personnel. Outside personnel should reassure the occupant that it is not possible for the elevator to fall, and that there is sufficient ventilation for comfort. The occupant should be made aware of any developments or changes in the arrival time of the elevator technician.

    -----------------------------------------------

    1.  Activate the elevator alarm by pushing the button marked “call bell.” This will alert others that there is a problem with one of the elevators. *The emergency stop switch should be used only when directed to do so by an elevator technician.*

    2.  Open the emergency phone door. Use the phone in order to establish and stay in contact with Security.

    3.  Remain calm and await help. There is no chance of the elevator falling and there is sufficient ventilation for comfort. In the event of a power failure, elevators have emergency lighting and ventilation.

    4.  Security will keep you informed of the status of response of emergency personnel.
