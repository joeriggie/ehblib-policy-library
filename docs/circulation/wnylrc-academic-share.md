AcademicSHARE Program

**What is AcademicSHARE?**

The AcademicSHARE program of the Western New York Library Resources Council allows participating member libraries and library systems to borrow and lend materials to library patrons who are in good standing. A valid ID card from the patron’s home institution allows patrons to borrow from and have on-site access to library materials at other participating WNYLRC member academic libraries.

AcademicSHARE is essentially a program that allows academic library users’ access to other academic libraries and resources that may be otherwise unavailable or difficult to obtain. AcademicSHARE is a Board of Trustees approved free voluntary program WNYLRC academic members can join in order to provide their patrons with this valuable service.

**Definitions: **

-   Lending library – library providing services to the visiting patron

-   Home library – library housed in the institution the patron attends or teaches classes

**What libraries can participate?**

-   All WNYLRC academic library members are eligible to participate in this voluntary program.

**Who can use AcademicSHARE?**

-   Library patrons with research needs who wish to increase their access to our region’s abundantly rich collections can use their home institution ID to gain access to other participating academic collections.

-   The librarian or information manager from the patron’s home library is responsible for assessing the patron’s information needs before sending the patron to another participating academic library.

**Patron’s responsibilities**

-   AcademicSHARE is a courtesy extended to patrons by their home academic library. Patrons are required to show their valid ID card when visiting and borrowing materials at participating academic libraries. Lending libraries have the choice of contacting the patron’s home library to verify good standing.

-   Patrons are required to abide by all rules and regulations of each of the libraries from which services are received. The AcademicSHARE privilege can be rescinded at any time if the patron abuses borrowing or viewing privileges. Patrons should be held fiscally responsible for any and all materials damaged, lost, or not returned to the lending library, but the patron’s home library has ultimate fiscal responsibility for unreturned items.

<!-- -->

-   After **three attempts** have been made by the lending library to collect on an overdue item, patrons will be billed for any materials not returned and are subject to fines for late returns. If the patron still does not return the item(s) to the lending library, the lending library has six months from the item’s due date to collect from the patron’s home library for costs to replace the items. As a professional courtesy, it is requested that overdue fines not be assessed to other AcademicSHARE participating libraries.

**Lending Policies**

-   Participating libraries will lend materials directly to any student or faculty member from a participating library with a valid student/faculty ID from their home institution.

-   Participating libraries will have a circulation desk phone number accessible to allow participating libraries to contact home libraries to check the validity of a borrower’s ID card.

-   Participating libraries will also lend materials directly to any InfoPass cardholder according to the policies specified on the AcademicSHARE annual application form.
