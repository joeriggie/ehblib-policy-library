**2005**

The schedule of library hours is based on the *Official* Academic Calendar. However, library hours are often established before the Official Academic Calendar is approved. The *Tentative* Academic Calendar may be used instead. It is recommended, therefore, that library hours be reviewed again once the Official Academic Calendar is published.

**Regular Schedule of Library Hours**

***Regular hours are in effect unless noted as an exception below.***

**Exceptions to the Regular Schedule of Library Hours**
=======================================================

The goal is to minimize the number of exceptions. Insofar as possible, the library should be open regular hours the day prior to classes being in session, e.g. regular hours on a Monday holiday, but reduced hours the weekend before.

***StudyQuad (opened May 6, 2004) will be open during regular library hours and may remain open beyond those hours. Generally, it will be open 24/5 during the fall and spring semesters and 24/7 during the last three weeks. It will be open during regular library hours only during the summer.***

**LIBRARY HOURS PREPARATION SCHEDULE**
======================================

The schedule of hours should be prepared at least six months in advance. The schedule must be entered into the Library Management System to establish due dates for materials check-out. College publications include library hours and require a long lead-time for preparation. Also, an established schedule facilitates room booking for the library and for the Events Management Office.

> Summer Hours: Prepare in January
>
> Fall Hours: Prepare in March
>
> Spring Hours: Prepare in July

Once the schedule is approved, the following persons and offices should be notified:

-   All Information Commons staff

-   Web page editor

-   University Police Student Assistants

-   Signature Café

-   TASC

-   Electronic Learning Office

-   Events Management Office

-   Campus Services

-   Custodial Services

***REQUESTS FOR EXCEPTIONS TO ESTABLISHED HOURS***

Occasionally the library receives requests to be open earlier or later than the established schedule to accommodate online registration, orientation activities, classes scheduled at unusual times requiring library use, etc. If library administration approves of the change, then:

-   Create the new schedule as soon as possible

-   Schedule staff to work the extra hours

-   Post signs

-   Advise:

    -   All public services staff

    -   Web page editor

    -   University Police Student Assistants

    -   Signature Café

    -   -   Electronic Learning Office

    -   Events Management Office

    -   Campus Services

    -   Custodial Services
