Welcome to Library. Student employees are extremely important to the operation of the library, and the permanent staff is very glad that you will be working here.

The following information is designed to acquaint you with general library procedures and to describe what will be expected of you. Please read the information carefully. Your supervisor will explain the specific practices followed by the unit of the library in which you will be working. Practices vary among the many different units because tasks are different and schedules are different.

If you have any questions about your job, be sure to go to *your* supervisor.

CHECKLIST
=========

-   **YOUR WORK SCHEDULE**

    -   You and your supervisor will agree on a schedule for the hours and days that you will work.

    -   You are expected to arrive at work on time and to complete your entire shift.

    -   You must call your supervisor or whomever your supervisor designates if you cannot come to work. In some cases a substitute will have to be found and advance notice is vital.

-   **TIME SHEETS**

    -   You must sign in and sign out on your time sheet each time you come to work.

    -   You must use ink on your time sheet.

    -   The time you start work and the time you leave work must be rounded to the nearest ¼ hour.

    -   You must sign your time sheet.

    -   labor law requires you to sign out for a minimum of ½ hour for a meal break after each six consecutive hours of work.

<!-- -->

-   **ATTENDANCE**

    -   Three unexcused absences are grounds for dismissal, at the discretion of your supervisor.

    -   If you know ahead of time that you will not be able to come to work at your scheduled day or time, you must give your supervisor as much notice as possible. Your supervisor *may* authorize you to “make-up” the time you will miss.

    -   Advancing time to student employees is not permitted.

-   **BREAKS**

    -   In some units the supervisor may authorize a “coffee break” for you—particularly if you are performing very physical tasks. Other units do not or cannot authorize breaks because of staffing constraints.

    -   Food and drink may be consumed in the library Staff Room, the Main Lobby or the Vending Room—*never in other public areas*.

    -   You are welcome to use the Staff Room facilities for meals or breaks.

<!-- -->

-   **DEMEANOR**

    -   Your supervisor will discuss specific behaviors with you, but you are expected to conduct yourself in a businesslike manner, i.e. you will be helpful and courteous at all times.

    -   You must wear or display whatever student employee identification your supervisor requires.

    -   You should remind your friends that while you are working you cannot socialize. They may not sit at staff desks, use staff computers, call on staff phones, etc.

    -   In most units using headphones or studying are not permitted because they interfere or distract you from performing your duties.

-   **TASKS**

    -   Your supervisor will teach you to perform the required job tasks. He or she will also tell you what you can do if you finish your assigned tasks before your scheduled departure time.

    -   Sometimes your supervisor will assign you to help out in another unit temporarily, which means someone else may be your temporary supervisor.

    -   It is possible that you will be scheduled to work when your supervisor is not available. Your supervisor will explain to whom you will report.

    -   You should maintain a neat and clean work area. Do not leave tools, materials or personal items in your work area

<!-- -->

-   **PAYCHECKS**

    -   You will sign for and pick up your paychecks at the Circulation Desk in the Lower Lobby after 3 pm on paydays.

    -   Your supervisor has the schedule of paydays.
