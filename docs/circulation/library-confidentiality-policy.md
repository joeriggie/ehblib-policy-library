E. H. Butler Library

SUNY Buffalo State

Federal law (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended), state law (New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, Section 4509, 1982, as amended), and professional ethics (American Library Association, 2002) address the confidential nature of library records.

> Butler Library staff must be mindful that information handled on a daily basis as part of normal library operations should be held confidential.

CIRCULATION SERVICES 
=====================

> Circulation records are confidential. Library staff cannot and should not reveal any information about what items patrons have checked out of the library. For example:

-   A patron is not entitled to know the name of a second patron who has an item checked out. If the first patron wants the item, Circulation staff should use the recall procedure.

<!-- -->

-   A faculty member is not entitled to know from library staff, which students in his or her classes have checked out materials that he or she has placed on reserve.

<!-- -->

-   Parents are not entitled to know from library staff what items their children have checked outeven if the children are minors.

<!-- -->

-   A police officer is not entitled to get a list from the library of items that have been checked out to a patron for any reason. For example, a patron reports a burglary to the police and indicates that library materials were stolen. The patron should supply the list, not the library, although library staff will assist a patron to create the list. Supervisors should be consulted in cases where a patron wants to supply a list to the police, but cannot do so, e.g. a patron is hospitalized.

Patron records are confidential. Library staff cannot and should not reveal the

names, addresses, telephone numbers, social security numbers, etc. of library

patrons. For example:

-   A student is not entitled to get a current address for a former roommate from library records.

<!-- -->

-   Printed lists or computer files of patron data should not be left where they are accessible to the public. Data must be appropriately destroyed.

REFERENCE SERVICES 
===================

> Information requests are confidential. The reference interview, interlibrary loan requests, database search requests, etc. cannot and should not be
>
> revealed. For example:

-   A library patron should not be casually told that another specific patron had earlier requested the same information.

-   Patrons should not be specifically identified for purposes of illustrating a research technique or for advocating a particular library resource.

ACQUISITIONS SERVICES 
======================

Library purchase recommendations and acquisitions are confidential. To guard against censorship and harassment, library staff should not reveal the name of the selector of a specific item. For example:

-   A patron who complains that the library owns books on bomb-making

should not be told the name of the selector(s).

-   Library staff should not reveal the name of a donor who wishes to remain anonymous.

SECURITY PROCEDURES 
====================

> Security procedures, codes, and passwords are confidential. Only authorized
>
> library staff should have this information. Library keys and key cards should not be shared with unauthorized persons. For example:

-   Authorized personnel should never give keys, passwords or codes for alarm systems or computer systems to unauthorized staff.

<!-- -->

-   The operations or procedures for use of alarm systems should not be revealed to unauthorized persons.

-   All library keys should be returned to Campus Services or to the supervisor by the person to whom they were issued. They should not be passed on to another staff member.

PERSONNEL RECORDS 
==================

> Information about library staff is confidential. Employment applications, reference letters, personnel action dossiers, discipline letters, Civil Service Lists, etc. should not be shared with unauthorized personnel. For example:

-   A request at the Reference Desk for a home telephone number or address of a staff member should not be honored unless that telephone number or address is published in the public telephone directory or in the campus telephone directory.

<!-- -->

-   A request for confirmation of current or previous employment at the college should be referred to the Office of Human Resource Management.

-   Library staff may provide letters of reference upon receipt of a written request on letterhead from another institution. It is an expected courtesy that a person gets prior permission to give the name of staff member as a reference.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
==================

Occasionally, law enforcement personnel have a legitimate need to consult confidential library records in the course of a criminal investigation or prosecution. In that event, the judicial system provides a specific mechanism for seeking release of confidential library recordsthe issuance of a **Court Order**.

When pressed for information or when presented with a Court Order, library personnel should immediately refer the matter to the Department Head or to the Library Director. It is college policy that the Office of the Vice President for Finance and Management (Grover Cleveland Hall 505, 878-4311) will handle all legal proceedings. If no administrative personnel are available, e.g. evenings and weekends, refer the matter to University Police (Chase Hall 110, 878-6333).

Under the provisions of the **USA PATRIOT Act** **of 2002** (Public Law 107-56) libraries in the United States have been receiving visits from agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation requesting access to circulation records and to the search histories and hard drives of public computers. Butler Library has been advised by the Vice President for Finance and Management to refer all such requests to University Police for verification. Once the request is verified as legitimate under the Act, Butler Library staff members are directed to provide the requested information if it is available. The Library Director’s Office must also be notified of all such requests and the actions that were taken.
