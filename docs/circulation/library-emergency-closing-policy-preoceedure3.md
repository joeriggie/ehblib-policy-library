**EMERGENCY CLOSING POLICY AND PROCEDURES**

**E. H. Butler Library SUNY Buffalo State **

See SUNY Buffalo State University Police [Emergency Closing](http://police.buffalostate.edu/emergency-buffalo-state-closings) Plan

Insofar as the campus cancels classes only in cases of extremely bad weather or other serious emergency conditions, **E. H. Butler Library, including StudyQuad, will not be open if classes are canceled.**

Should the college cancel classes during the course of the day, E. H. Butler Library will remain open one half hour after the close of classes. In the case of the most extreme emergency, if the staff cannot stay, the library may elect to close at the same time that the classes cease.

-   Signs will be posted on the front doors by the Information Commons Department.

-   Answering machine and voice mail messages will be updated by the Associate Vice President for Library and Instructional Technology Office (6302 and 6314) and Reference (6300).

-   A notice will be posted at the top of the library Web page.

**The Associate Vice President for Library and Instructional Technology in consultation with Academic Affairs, the CIO, and the Associate Director for Information Commons will determine weekend and intersession closings when the college has no classes scheduled to cancel.** Weather reports and community closings will help determine the decision to close.

-   University Police will be notified by the Associate Vice President for Library and Instructional Technology.

**LIBRARY EMERGENCY INFORMATION TELEPHONE NUMBER: 878-6302**

The Library Administration Office will be responsible for recording a voice mail message for library staff and the public that will indicate the status of the library.

The recorded message on the Reference Desk line, 878-6300, refers patrons to the Emergency Information Telephone Number at 878-6302.

**LIBRARY STAFF EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS**

To ensure that all shifts are advised of emergency closings the Associate Vice President for Library and Instructional Technology will notify department heads or their designees by telephone. Departments will arrange internal telephone notifications, including notifying their student employees. All library staff members must tell department heads and the Library Administration Office their current telephone numbers—including mobile phones and pagers. Staff members will be provided with lists of appropriate telephone numbers.

The Information Commons Department should advise University Police when University Police Student Assistants are needed or not needed.
