The schedule of library hours should be based on the *Official* Academic Calendar. However, the schedule is generally established long before the *Official* Academic Calendar is approved. The *Tentative* Academic Calendar is used in the preparation of the schedule. It is recommended, therefore, that library hours be reviewed again once the *Official* Academic Calendar is published.
