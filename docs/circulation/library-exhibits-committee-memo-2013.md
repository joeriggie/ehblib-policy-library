I am pleased to appoint you to the E. H. Butler Library Exhibits Committee.

The Exhibits Committee oversees the exhibits displayed in the library cases and hanging in our circulation and mezzanine galleries. We are honored to provide space for our arts students, many of whom are required to exhibit in order to fulfill their degree requirements. We also have standing commitments to provide the campus community with display space for special months: Native American History, African American History, Women’s History, etc. The Student Research and Creativity Celebration is also a standing commitment.

Although community artists display from time to time, we usually do that during the summer or early in the semester before student work is ready.

It is necessary to maintain a master calendar and only confirm exhibits when the exhibitor has returned the signed agreement form which you must keep on file.

It is important to have displays in situ for big events like Open House, Orientation, etc. If an exhibitor is a “no show” the Exhibits Committee provides something of interest from our collections.

We want the library to adhere to professional display practices as much as possible. Please ensure that exhibitors hang their works in a professional manner. We take pride in the appearance of our building.

The Exhibits Committee ensures that the installations are announced and promoted in the campus and local media. They should also have a link on our webpages. Please keep a history of all exhibits, exhibitors, and their dates and submit to my office annually. These are often consulted years later, especially if the artist becomes famous.

Attached is the Exhibit Agreement approved in 2004. Please feel free to propose improvements and updates that I can take to the Library Managers group for approval.

And please feel free to stop by my office for advice or consultation. I very much appreciate the energy and expertise you bring to this assignment.
