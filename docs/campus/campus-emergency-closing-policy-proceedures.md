<span id="emergency" class="anchor"></span> Closings
**Preface**
This serves as a notice to new employees and a reminder to others of the procedures to follow during snow emergencies and other extraordinary circumstances. Offices and other facilities operated by the state may be closed only by order of the governor; however, the college president or her designee is authorized to cancel classes and recommend that all but essential service\* employees not report to work.

**Policy and Procedures**
The president has delegated the authority to cancel classes and services to the vice president for finance and management. University Police is responsible for monitoring all relevant weather conditions and reporting to the vice president for finance and management.

If the decision to close the college and cancel classes is made before the start of the workday, the vice president for finance and management will inform University Police. If the decision to close is made once classes are in session, the vice president for finance and management will consult with the vice president for academic affairs and notify University Police of the decision. University Police will notify the following broadcast stations in either case:

An early decision to close the college and cancel classes will be relayed to the stations listed above by about 6:00 a.m. For information concerning cancellation of classes, please check the main page of the Buffalo State Web site, [*www.buffalostate.edu*](http://www.buffalostate.edu), or call the school closing information number, 878-5000. Please do not call any other number for this information.

**Attendance Policy under Emergency Conditions**
If classes and services are canceled before the workday begins, employees designated essential service\* are required to report. All other employees are excused under emergency conditions but must charge the absence to appropriate leave accruals. Employees who elect to come to work may do so; however, the college cannot guarantee that they will be able to work at their usual locations or perform their normal duties. (See instructions below for employees who choose to report for work under emergency conditions.)

Should the closure occur during the workday, the vice president for finance and management will convey the decision to the other vice presidents, who will ensure that the announcement is communicated throughout their respective areas. Again, essential service\* employees are required to remain on the job or report to work as scheduled in this instance. Following official closure, employees may leave their work sites and charge the remainder of their workdays to appropriate leave accruals or continue working until their regular departure time.

Absences that result from the cancellation of classes and services must be charged to appropriate leave accruals as described below.

1.  Vacation, personal, compensatory, or holiday leave

2.  Sick leave, but only in the event of personal or family illness

3.  Leave without pay (A written request must be submitted to the Human Resource Management Office no later than the end of the pay period in which the attendance record is due.)

\*Essential services are those that must be maintained to ensure the well-being and protection of those who reside on campus, as well as the maintenance and security of college property. The following functions are considered essential services. Employees assigned to these areas are required to report to work under emergency conditions:

-   The law enforcement division of University Police

-   Campus services and facilities operations (all employees)

-   Student health services (designated staff only)

-   Residence Life (designated staff only)

-   The dean of students

-   Staff responsible for the care and feeding of animals and maintenance of greenhouse facilities

All employees who are designated essential service will be notified in writing by their department heads.

**Directed Absences**
Any employee who has reported to work and because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the employee's control (i.e., extremely hazardous conditions or physical plant breakdown) is directed by the college president or her designee to leave work shall not be required to charge this absence to leave accruals. Any such release of employees shall not create any right to equivalent time off to employees who are not directed to leave work. Supervisors, regardless of their good intentions, may not direct such absences.

**Instructions for Nonessential Service Employees Who Elect to Report for Work under Emergency Conditions**
Note: Parking may be severely restricted during periods of temporary emergency. Employees who report to work under these conditions must park in the lot so that other lots may be cleared of snow.

1.  Employees must report to University Police, Chase Hall 110, to sign the Attendance Record/Emergency Conditions sheet. Employees also must sign the sheet before leaving campus.

2.  Employees report to regular work locations and perform regular duties, even if their supervisor is absent.

3.  If the employee's regular work location is not accessible, he or she must report to the director of Campus Services and Facilities, Clinton Center, ext. 6111, or the director of Residence Life, Porter Hall, ext. 3000, for assignment.
