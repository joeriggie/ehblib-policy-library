Emergency Notification Procedures

When you call 878-6333 from a campus location to request emergency assistance, you will be connected to the University Police Dispatch. Call from a safe location and remember to:

• Stay calm.

• Be prepared to answer the following questions:

—Where is the emergency located?

—What is the emergency? (fire, medical, hazardous material, etc.)

—How did it happen?

—When did it happen?

—Who are you? (your name)

• Gather any other information that may be useful for the emergency responders (e.g. are there any injuries involved?).

• Do not hang up until instructed to do so by the dispatcher.

You do not need to know all the answers to these questions, but quickly gather as much information as you can. Give a telephone number or safe location where the emergency responders can call or meet you, and wait for the responders at that safe location.

Add other steps, actions or precautions specific to your building or work area.
