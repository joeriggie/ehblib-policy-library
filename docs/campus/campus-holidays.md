-   Public services employees should always consult supervisors to schedule holiday time off. The library may be open to the public on a given holiday, e.g. Monday, October 8, 2001, which requires some staff to work on that holiday.

<!-- -->

-   Staff members who do not work in public services should also consult supervisors to schedule holiday time off.

-   Staff members who must work or who choose to work on official holidays may arrange with their supervisors to take a compensatory day off or to accrue (i.e. save) the holiday to be used some time within twelve months of the date the holiday occurs.

-   Staff members are urged to observe holidays on the specific dates that the campus or the library is closed in observance of that holiday, e.g. Independence Day.

-   Staff members will account for holidays on their attendance reports (under the “Comp Time” heading).

-   Holiday accruals must be exhausted before using Annual Leave accruals.

-   Special rules apply to those who work *part-time*. Observance of holidays is dependent on the individual work schedule. Supervisors should be consulted.

-   Questions regarding attendance rules should be addressed to supervisors or to Gay Hardoby, Human Resource Management, GC 403, ext. 5102.
