Emergency Response Plan

 **CAMPUS EMERGENCY OPERATIONS: CONCEPT,**
==========================================

 **STRUCTURE AND ACTION**
=========================

4.1 Functional Organization
---------------------------

Every employee can potentially play a role in the Incident Command System (ICS). Perhaps the most critical aspect of the ICS is communications; accurate reports from the scene of an incident are essential to providing adequate emergency services. Similarly, the campus community must receive up-to-date instructions concerning disaster response procedures and news of the evolving incidents.

4.2 Role of Students
--------------------

Every student should familiarize themselves with the emergency procedures and evacuation routes in buildings they live in or use frequently. Students must be prepared to assess situations quickly but thoroughly, and use common sense in determining a course of action. They should evacuate assembly areas in an orderly manner when an alarm sounds or when directed to do so by emergency personnel.

 4.3 Role of Faculty and Staff
------------------------------

Every member of the faculty and staff should read and understand both their Building and Department Emergency Plans and familiarize themselves with their emergency procedures and evacuation routes. Employees must be prepared to assess situations quickly but thoroughly, and use common sense in determining a course of action. They should follow Emergency Plan procedures to report fire or other emergencies that require immediate attention, and evacuate the building to pre-designated areas in an orderly manner. Faculty members are seen as leaders by students and should be prepared to direct their students to assembly areas in the event of an emergency.

 4.4 Role of the Building Coordinator (BC)
------------------------------------------

Each Building Coordinator is responsible for developing a Building Emergency Plan. Building Coordinators are responsible for ensuring that Building Emergency Response Team (BERT) is designated. In the event of an emergency, the Building Coordinator is responsible for coordinating safe evacuation (with the assistance of BERT). The Building Coordinator acts as the liaison to the EOC.

4.5 Building Emergency Plans
----------------------------

Developed under the guidance of the Building Coordinator, the Building Emergency Plan is a building-specific operational guide outlining emergency operations and responsibilities. Building Emergency Plans go into effect in the event of an emergency, allowing the Building Coordinators to evacuate personnel to their designated evacuation areas.

**5. GENERAL EVACUATION PROCEDURES**
====================================

An evacuation is defined as the emptying of an occupied area and the transference of its occupants to a safe location. A critical element of any evacuation is transportation. In many campuses and communities, auto-dependent commuters congest roadways to the point of “gridlock.” The dense urban population, high number of resident students and use of transportation alternatives at Buffalo State College must be taken into account when planning the steps necessary to evacuate all campus occupants, whether they arrived by public transit, single-occupant auto, carpool, or bicycle.

**In a major emergency**, the decision to implement evacuation procedures generally rests with the EOC Jurisdiction Executive. In situations requiring immediate action, public safety responders (Police, Fire, Environmental Health & Safety) can also order an evacuation. When evaluating a possible evacuation, consideration will be given to the specific threat (bomb, fire, storm, explosion, hazardous materials incident, etc.), its context (time of day, likelihood, etc.) and the recommendation of first responders.

*When evacuating your building or work area:*

• Stay calm; do not rush and do not panic.

• Safely stop your work.

• Gather your personal belongings if it is safe to do so. (Reminder: take prescription medications out with you if at all possible; it may be hours before you are allowed back in the building.)

• If safe, close your office door and window, but do not lock them.

• Use the nearest safe stairs and proceed to the nearest exit. Do *not* use the elevator.

• Wait for any instructions from emergency responders.

• Do not re-enter the building or work area until you have been instructed to do so by the emergency responders.

A building occupant is required *by law* to evacuate the building when the fire alarm sounds.

5.1 Evacuation Policy for People With Disabilities

The following guidelines have been adopted by Buffalo State College to help evacuate people with physical disabilities. Evacuating a disabled or injured person yourself is the last resort. Consider your options and the risks of injuring yourself and others in an evacuation attempt. Do not make an emergency situation worse.

Evacuation is difficult and uncomfortable for both the rescuers and the people being assisted. Some people have conditions that can be aggravated or triggered if they are moved incorrectly. Remember that environmental conditions (smoke, debris, loss of electricity) will complicate evacuation efforts.

The following guidelines are general and may not apply in every circumstance.

• Occupants should be invited to *volunteer* ahead of time to assist disabled people in an emergency. If a volunteer is not available, designate someone to assist who is willing to accept the responsibility.

• Volunteers should obtain evacuation training for certain types of lifting techniques.

• Two or more trained volunteers, if available, should conduct the evacuation.

• DO NOT evacuate disabled people in their wheelchairs. This is standard practice to ensure the safety of disabled people and volunteers. Wheelchairs will be evacuated later if possible.

• Always ASK someone with a disability how you can help BEFORE attempting any rescue technique or giving assistance. Ask how they can best be assisted or moved, and whether there are any special considerations or items that need to come with them.

• Before attempting an evacuation, volunteers and the people being assisted should discuss how any lifting will be done and where they are going.

• Proper lifting techniques (e.g. bending the knees, keeping the back straight, holding the person close before lifting, and using leg muscles to lift) should be used to avoid injury to rescuers' backs. Ask permission of the evacuee if an evacuation chair or similar device is being considered as an aid in an evacuation. When using such devices, make sure the person is secured properly. Be careful on stairs and rest at landings if necessary.

• Certain lifts may need to be modified depending on the person's disabilities.

• DO NOT use elevators, unless authorized to do so by police or fire personnel. Elevators could fail during a fire.

• If the situation is life threatening, call University Police at 878-6333.

• Check on people with special needs during an evacuation. A "buddy system", where people with disabilities arrange for volunteers (co-workers/ neighbors) to alert them and assist them in an emergency, is a good method.

• Attempt a rescue evacuation ONLY if you have had rescue training or the person is in immediate danger and cannot wait for professional assistance.

> • If an outage occurs during the day and people with disabilities choose to wait in the
>
> building for electricity to be restored, they can move near a window where there is
>
> natural light and access to a working telephone. During regular building hours,
>
> Building Coordinators should be notified so they can advise emergency personnel.

• If people would like to leave and an evacuation has been ordered, or if the outage occurs at night, call University Police at 878-6333 from a campus telephone to request evacuation assistance from the Fire Department.

• Some multi-button campus telephones may not operate in a power outage, but single-line telephones and pay telephones are likely to be operating.

Blindness or Visual Impairment

Bomb Threat, Fire, Hazardous Materials Releases, and Power Outages:

• Give verbal instructions to advise about the safest route or direction using compass directions, estimated distances, and directional terms.

• DO NOT grasp a visually impaired person's arm. Ask if he or she would like to hold onto your arm as you exit, especially if there is debris or a crowd.

• Give other verbal instructions or information (i.e. elevators cannot be used).

Deafness or Hearing Loss

Bomb Threat, Fire, Hazardous Materials Releases, and Power Outages:

• Get the attention of a person with a hearing disability by touch and eye contact. Clearly state the problem. Gestures and pointing are helpful, but be prepared to write a brief statement if the person does not seem to understand.

• Offer visual instructions to advise of safest route or direction by pointing toward exits or evacuation maps.

Mobility Impairment

Bomb Threat, Fire, and Hazardous Materials Releases:

• It may be necessary to help clear the exit route of debris (if possible) so that the person with a disability can move out or to a safer area.

• If people with mobility impairments cannot exit, they should move to a *safer area,* e.g.,

— most enclosed stairwells

— an office with the door shut which is a good distance from the hazard

If you do not know the safer areas in your building, call University Police at 878-6333.

• Notify emergency responders immediately about any people remaining in the building and their locations.

• Police or fire personnel will decide whether people are safe where they are and will evacuate them as necessary. The Fire Department may determine that it is safe to override the rule against using elevators.

• If people are in immediate danger and cannot be moved to a safer area to wait for assistance, it may be necessary to evacuate them using an evacuation chair or a carry technique.

5.2

Fire Evacuation Procedures

Follow General Evacuation Procedures as soon as you hear the fire alarm.

A building occupant is required *by law* to evacuate the building when the fire alarm sounds.

*If there is a fire in your work area:*

• First, notify the fire department by pulling the pull station and (from a safe distance) calling University Police at 878-6333 to provide details of the situation.

• If you have been trained in the use of a portable fire extinguisher and are able to safely extinguish the fire, you may do so. Be sure you have a safe exit from the area and leave if one extinguisher does not put out the fire.

• Evacuate the building as soon as the alarm sounds and report to Building Coordinator (see "General Evacuation Procedures" above).

• On your way out, warn others nearby.

• Move away from fire and smoke. Close doors and windows if time permits.

• Touch closed doors. Do not open them if they are hot.

• Use stairs only; do not use elevators.

• Move well away from the building and go to your designated Immediate Assembly Area (IAA).

• Do not re-enter the building or work area until you have been instructed to do so by the emergency responders.

### 6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES

6.1 Emergency College Closings

The following procedures should be followed during snow emergencies and other

extraordinary circumstances.

State-operated offices and facilities may be closed only by order of the governor; however,

#### Attendance Policy under Emergency Conditions

If classes and services are canceled before the workday begins, employees designated

essential service\* are required to report. All other employees are excused under emergency

conditions, but must charge the absence to appropriate leave accruals. Employees who

elect to come to work may do so; however, the college cannot guarantee that they will be

able to work at their usual locations or perform their normal duties. (See instructions below

for employees who choose to report for work under emergency conditions.)

Should the closure occur during the workday, the Vice President for Finance and Management

will convey the decision to the other Vice Presidents, who will ensure that the announcement

is communicated throughout their respective areas. Following official closure, employees

may leave their work sites and charge the remainder of their workdays to appropriate leave

accruals or continue working until their regular departure time. Essential service\* employees

are required to remain on the job or report to work as scheduled in this instance.

Absences that result from the cancellation of classes and services must be charged to

appropriate leave accruals as described below:

1. Vacation, personal, compensatory, or holiday leave

2. Sick leave, but only in event of personal or family illness

3. Leave without pay (A written request must be submitted to the Human Resource

Management Office no later than the end of the pay period in which the attendance

record is due.)

\*Essential services are those that must be maintained to ensure the well-being and

protection of those who reside on campus, as well as the maintenance and security of

college property. The following functions are considered essential services. Employees

assigned to these areas are required to report to work under emergency conditions:

The law enforcement division of University Police

Campus Services and Facilities operations (all employees)

Staff responsible for the care and feeding of animals or maintenance of greenhouse

facilities

Employees designated as essential service will be notified in writing by their department

heads.

#### Directed Absences

Any employee who has reported to work and because of extraordinary circumstances

beyond his or her control (e.g., extremely hazardous conditions or physical plant breakdown)

is directed by the College President or her designee to leave work shall not be required to

charge this absence to leave accruals. Any such release of employees shall not create the

right to equivalent time off for employees who are not directed to leave work. ,

regardless of their good intentions, may not direct such absences.

**Instructions for Nonessential Service Employees Who Elect to Report for Work under**

**Emergency Conditions**

Note: Parking may be severely restricted during periods of temporary emergency.

Employees who report to work under these conditions must park in the lot so

that other lots may be cleared of snow.

1. Employees must report to University Police, Chase Hall 110, to sign the Attendance

Record/Emergency Conditions sheet. They must also sign the sheet before leaving

campus.

2. Employees report to regular work locations and perform regular duties, even if

supervisor is absent.

3. If the employee's regular work location is not accessible, he or she must report to the

Director of Campus Services and Facilities, , 878-6111, or the Director of

Residence Life, Porter Hall, 878-6806, for assignment.

6.2 Civil Disturbance/Demonstration Procedures

Most campus demonstrations are peaceful and people not involved should attempt to carry on business as usual. Avoid provoking or obstructing demonstrators. Should a disturbance occur, call the University Police at 878-6333.

6.5 Hazardous Materials Procedures

If you witness a hazardous material spill, evacuate the spill site and warn others to stay away. Call University Police at 878-6333 if you believe the spill may be life threatening. If you can determine that the spill is not life threatening, follow the procedures outlined below.

If you are a hazardous material user, you should be trained by your supervisor on proper use and storage of hazardous materials. This training should include hazard information, proper procedures for preventing spills, and emergency procedures when a spill happens.

If you spill a hazardous material or materials:

• Leave the area of the spill first and proceed to a safe location nearby. Then assess if you have the proper training and protective gear to clean up the spill.

• If you are able to clean up the spill, follow proper cleanup procedures and use proper personal protection. Manage the generated waste as appropriate. Consult your supervisor if necessary.

• Isolate the spill area to keep everyone away, and post signs as necessary.

• If you require assistance to clean up the spill:

> Police at 878-6333. University Police will call Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S).

• If you suspect or witness a release of a hazardous material to the environment (air, water, ground) call University Police at 878-6333.

> 6.5.1 Mail

How to Respond to Suspicious Packages

1.  Every department should assess and review their protocols for handling mail. Use common sense and care when inspecting and opening mail. Some “red flags” to identify suspicious packages include:

Packages with no return address or excessive postage.

Misspellings of common words or restrictive markings such as “personal” or “confidential”.

Items protruding from the envelope or package, wet areas, tears, or strange odors.

Unusually heavy envelope and/or the presence of small bulges of powder or granules.

Generally, do not open letters with your hands; instead, use a letter opener. Use minimal movements when opening letters and packages, to avoid spilling any contents. Each department should assess whether it is a possible target for criminal acts. Based on this assessment, you may wish to take additional precautions such as wearing gloves, and restricting the opening of mail to a limited number of trained individuals.

If you are concerned about a particular package, do not open, shake, smell, touch, or taste it. If possible, place the envelope or package in a plastic bag. There is a low risk of exposure to you if the envelope or package remains intact. Call 6333 (if on campus) or 878-6333 (if at an off campus location) and inform University Police that you have a suspicious package.

1.  If you open an envelope or package and you find a letter that contains a threatening message:

• Replace the letter in the envelope, and, if possible, place the envelope in a plastic bag.

• Wash your hands with soap and water, or use a hand sanitizing gel or wipe to clean

> up.

• Call 6333 or 878-6333, remain at your work location, and wait for an officer to arrive.

1.  If you open an envelope or package and you observe some type of powder, or powder spills out, REMAIN CALM:

> • Slowly and carefully, place the envelope or package on a desk or floor and cover with an empty garbage or recycling container to prevent additional exposures. Do not clean up any powder, and avoid further contact.
>
> • Move away from the envelope or package, and inform others in your office to leave the area. Do not walk around the office to show other people, nor invite co-workers to come in and look.
>
> • If your clothes are contaminated, do not brush vigorously as this action may disperse the powder into the air. Remain in place and wait for further instructions from emergency responders.

• Do not touch your eyes, nose, mouth, or any other part of your body.

• Close off the room, including any doors or windows. If possible, close down the

> building’s heating/air conditioning/ventilation system.
>
> • If possible, and without contaminating large areas, wash your hands with soap and water, or use a hand sanitizing gel or wipe to clean up.
>
> • Call 6333 or 878-6333 to report the incident and inform the University Police what steps you have taken. Remain nearby to assist the responding officer(s).
>
> • Make a list of all people who had actual contact with the powder, or were in the area of a release of powder.

-   University Police will then contact the Buffalo Fire Department HAZMAT team or the ambulance service for further assistance.

4. If Buffalo Fire Department HAZMAT team or the ambulance service is unable to respond, University Police will instruct you on how to proceed to the campus de-contamination unit located in Central Receiving, Building \#44.

-   University Police will provide you with a tyvek suit. ***Slowly*** put on the suit at the scene of the incident to contain any residual power. REMAIN CALM and try not to disturb or disperse any powder into the air.

-   University Police will escort you to the de-contamination unit which can be accessed through the northeast outside door of Central Receiving. The door is marked “Emergency Response Entrance”.

-   A supply locker located outside the de-contamination unit contains clean tyvek suits, booties, antibacterial soap, towels, bags, and tape.

-   Enter room A of the de-contamination unit, take off all clothing, double bag, seal with tape and place into provided container.

-   Proceed to the shower.

-   Take a shower with the antibacterial soap and hot water for at least 15 minutes, towel off and place towels into a separate bag and seal with tape.

-   Proceed to room B of the de-contamination unit, put on a clean tyvek suit and remain in place for further instructions from University Police.

5. If there is a small explosion or release of an aerosol spray from a package:

> • Vacate the space immediately and prevent others from entering. Treat yourself and your clothing as in \#3, above.
>
> • Call 6333 or 878-6333 and remain at a safe distance to provide information to the University Police officer.

6.6 Utility Failure

In the event of a major utility failure during regular business hours, notify Campus Services at 878-6111. Before and after or on weekends and holidays, notify University Police at 878-6333.

Evacuate the building if the fire alarm sounds and/or upon notification by University Police (see "General Evacuation Procedures" above).

A major power outage may not in itself be destructive, but a possible resulting panic or fire could endanger life and property. Panic can be partially avoided by an immediate decision on the need to cancel classes or meetings in progress or to evacuate the building (see "General Evacuation Procedures" above).

In laboratory buildings, fume hoods do not operate during a power outage and most laboratories should not be used until the ventilation is properly restored.

6.7 Elevator Failure

If you are trapped in an elevator, use the emergency telephone to call for assistance.

If the elevator does not have an emergency telephone, turn on the emergency alarm (located on the control panel) to signal your need for help.

Do not attempt to free yourself from the elevator.

6.8 Flooding/Plumbing Failure

*If flooding occurs (due to a plumbing failure or other problem):*

• Cease using all electrical equipment.

• Notify University Police at 878-6333. If necessary, evacuate the building (see "General Evacuation Procedures" above).

6.9 Gas Leak

*If you smell natural gas:*

• Cease all operations immediately.

• Do not switch lights on or off.

• Notify University Police at 878-6333 from a safe location.

• Evacuate as soon as possible (see "General Evacuation Procedures" above).

6.10 Steam Line Failure

*In the event of a steam line failure:*

• Notify the University Police by calling 878-6333.

• Evacuate as soon as possible (see "General Evacuation Procedures" above).

6.11 Ventilation Problem

*If odors come from the ventilation system:*

• Immediately notify Campus Services at 878-6111.

• If smoke is present, activate the fire alarm system by pulling the pull station and call

University Police at 878-6333 from a safe location.

• If necessary, cease all operations and evacuate area (see "General Evacuation Procedures" above).

**7. OFF-CAMPUS ASSISTANCE AND MUTUAL AID**
===========================================

Neither Buffalo State College nor any municipality or jurisdiction has the resources to effectively handle all potential emergencies.

• Stay calm.

• Be prepared to answer the following questions:

—Where is the emergency located?

—What is the emergency? (fire, medical, hazardous material, etc.)

—How did it happen?

—When did it happen?

—Who are you? (your name)

• Gather any other information that may be useful for the emergency responders (e.g. are there any injuries involved?).

• Do not hang up until instructed to do so by the dispatcher.

You do not need to know all the answers to these questions, but quickly gather as much information as you can. Give a telephone number or safe location where the emergency responders can call or meet you, and wait for the responders at that safe location.

Add other steps, actions or precautions specific to your building or work area.

**RE: VOLUNTARY SELF-IDENTIFICATION **

> **OF PERSONS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS**

In an emergency, persons with disabilities and others who require assistance may need special attention in the unlikely event of a health or safety emergency on campus.

Persons with disabilities or certain types of medical conditions may have limitations on their ability to assist themselves during emergencies that require evacuation from the building.

In an effort to pre-determine those who may require assistance in the event of a building or campus emergency, you may voluntarily complete the information below, if applicable. The information will be held in confidence and be shared only with emergency response personnel. Please return this form in the envelope provided.

**RE: EMERGENCY RESPONSE VOLUNTEERS**

We are calling for volunteers who would be willing to help with emergency response situations that may affect employees working in the . This could include ensuring that the building is evacuated during a fire drill or giving aid to someone with a disability who may need help navigating during an emergency, or being able to advise other emergency response personnel of volatile material storage locations, etc.

In a campus-wide or regional emergency, those who might normally be available to attend to the specific needs of this building may be drawn away to perform other campus-wide roles.

We need multiple layers of back-up personnel to help ensure that, no matter who is sick, scheduled off, or is providing service in another location, someone is physically available to help coordinate an emergency response for this building.

If this sounds like something in which you may be interested, please contact me at ext. with further questions or stop in to see me before .

Thanks for your interest in the prospect of helping others.

**RE: BUILDING EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM**

This is to advise that a Building Emergency Response Team (BERT) has been designated for this building, to provide leadership in the event of a campus-wide, regional or building emergency.

Led by a Building Coordinator, the team is authorized to help ensure the safety of building occupants by identifying critical operations or material hazards, for example, or by helping people with special needs who may require attention during such emergencies.

Critical operations could include some type of business process, such as a lab experiment (in an instructional building) or storage tank refueling (near a maintenance building) that should not be left unattended, or which would require specific measures taken to ensure that it is left in a stable condition.

Most often, team members will monitor building evacuations during routine drills, however, they are also fully authorized to coordinate responses that might include evacuations for extended time periods or other extreme response measures.

Building Coordinators will also work with the team to formulate specific response procedures for all building occupants, based on the nature of an emergency. Response procedures will be shared with occupants as they are developed and drills will be conducted. The building emergency response plan developed by the team will be shared with a planning group who will make it part of the overall campus response plan.

Team members are as follows:

Both now and in the future, please be responsive to requests for information and to directives given by team members during emergencies.

Team membership will be renewed annually, but please feel free to call my office or contact the team at any time to express an interest in joining.

Thanks for your help.
