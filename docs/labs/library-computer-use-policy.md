**DRAFT 2**

COMPUTER USE POLICY
-------------------

E. H. BUTLER LIBRARY
====================

BUFFALO STATE COLLEGE

Computers in Butler Library are for the use of Buffalo State College students, faculty, staff and emeriti faculty and staff. Each person must have a user name and password to access a computer.

Guest logins are only for individuals who are temporarily associated with Buffalo State College, such as visiting scholars. In such cases a letter from a department chairperson is required. The librarian must type in the guest login username and password; this information is not given to patrons or to student computer assistants.

If a patron’s user name or password does not work, that person should be advised to go to Computing and Technology Services in Twin Rise, room 202, as soon as possible to resolve the problem. Photo identification, such as a SUNYCard or driver’s license, is required.

All other library patrons, without exception, must use the Express Stations in the front of the Reference Room. This includes alumni, Empire State students, Friends of the Library, students and faculty from other institutions, members of the community and anyone else who does not have a Buffalo State username and password.

Express Stations do not have word processing or the Microsoft Office Suite. Butler Library’s licensing agreement with Microsoft permits usage to students, faculty and staff of Buffalo State College only.
