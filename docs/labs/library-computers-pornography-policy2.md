**Procedures for Addressing Inappropriate Use of Public Computers**

**E. H. Butler Library **

> Displaying sexually explicit pictures or cartoons may be considered sexual harassment. Butler Library will report to University Police any complaints of sexual harassment that may result from the display of sexually explicit materials on the computers in this building.
>
> ï£§ BSC Policy on Sexual Harassment, Section II

Notices explaining the policy will be posted at locations in the library where there are public computers. The overriding principle is to act immediately upon receiving a complaint.

-   Library Staff

> You are not expected to inspect or pass judgment on the work of computer users. If you happen to see someone viewing something you believe is inappropriate or offensive, you can tell him or her that he or she is using state resources inappropriately *or* point out the posted notice *or* hand the person a flyer. If you prefer not to talk to the patron directly, call 6333 and ask University Police to handle the situation. Make sure you report the exact location of the person.
>
> If a patron reports to you that someone is viewing something he or she believes is inappropriate or offensive, call 6333 to report the complaint to University Police. Make sure you report the exact location of the offender.

-   University Police Student Assistants (UPSAs)

> UPSAs are not expected to inspect or pass judgment on the work of computer users. If a UPSA happens to see someone viewing something he or she believes is inappropriate or offensive, he or she should report it to a library staff member. The library staff member may deal with the patron directly or may prefer to refer the matter to University Police.
>
> If a patron reports to a UPSA that someone is viewing something he or she considers to be inappropriate or offensive, the UPSA should radio a report to University Police immediately, without having to report it to a library staff member.

-   In the event that the patron viewing the questionable material is identified as a BSC student who is legitimately doing library research (e.g. a criminal justice paper on pornography and the web, a computer information systems report on the mis-use of metatags, etc.), refer him/her to the Reference Librarian to make special arrangements for a more private place to use a computer for research.

> If the patron is not a student, the library supports the practice of University Police directing the person to leave the premises.

The BSC student activity fee provides the computers that are available for student use in the library. Plans are underway to institute user logins. Once this is in effect, the problem of non-BSC web surfers using library computers should be eliminated.
