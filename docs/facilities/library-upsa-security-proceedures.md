**StudyQuad**

**UPSA Policies and Procedures**

E. H. Butler Library

When StudyQuad closes the same time the library closes, procedures for closing the library will remain the same. UPSA’s will assist with closedown of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors of the library 30 minutes before the library closes. UPSA’s will then assist with the closedown of the 1<sup>st</sup> floor and StudyQuad 15 minutes before the library closes. UPSA’s will remain on duty until all patrons are out of the library.

When StudyQuad remains open after the library closes, the following will be the closedown procedures for UPSA’s:

**30 minutes before the library closes, UPSA’s will:**

• Assist with the closedown of the 2nd and 3rd floors of the library.

• Patrons wishing to remain in the library after it closes must move to StudyQuad and must have on their person, a current, valid Buffalo State ID card. Patrons who do not have in their possession a Buffalo State ID card must check in at the StudyQuad desk to have their record verified in the library database by a StudyQuad staff assistant.

**At library closing time, UPSA’s will:**

• Make sure that the library is empty and all remaining patrons are in StudyQuad. The UPSA’s remaining on duty will also relocate to StudyQuad. The inside doors to StudyQuad will be locked and alarmed by library staff. The outside entrance to StudyQuad will be opened and the alarm will be shut off.

• Will accompany library staff to check and validate ID’s of all patrons remaining in StudyQuad. If a patron does not have a current, valid Buffalo State ID card, the patron will be asked stop at the StudyQuad desk to have their record verified in the library database. UPSA’s will contact University Police if a patron will not comply with this rule or becomes unruly.

• Will maintain a continuous presence at the StudyQuad desk to help ensure that all incoming patrons have valid, current ID cards. Library staff will check ID’s in the computer. UPSA’s will observe and report problems.

**Ongoing Procedures:**

• UPSA’s will continuously patrol StudyQuad. Unruly patrons and patrons who have food or uncovered beverages will be asked to leave.

• Follow established procedures for checking for library materials when the book detection alarm sounds. The book detection alarm system is in place at the entrance/exit of StudyQuad.

• UPSA’s will provide information concerning the Buffalo State Escort Van to patrons.

• UPSA’s will observe all established rules and regulations for behavior in StudyQuad.

• All questions and concerns about StudyQuad procedures should be referred to Maureen Lindstrom, x6236, or Marsha Jurkowski, x6682.
