E. H. Butler Library Procedures

As everyone knows, the library and several other building on campus experienced an un-scheduled 30-minute power outage on April 15, 2002. A library staff member happened to be in the public elevator between floors at the time. Luckily, he got out safely.

In the future in the event of an un-scheduled power outage, please take the following steps:

1.  Immediately check the public elevator (floors 1, 2, and 3) and the staff elevator (floors 1, 2 and 3) to find out if anyone is trapped. University Police Student Assistants have also been directed to do this.

2.  If anyone is trapped, immediately report to University Police.

3.  Advise the trapped person(s) to stay calm, wait until help arrives, and *DO NOT* FORCE DOORS OPEN OR CLIMB OUT OF THE ELEVATOR.

4.  Check all rest rooms to see if anyone needs assistance.
