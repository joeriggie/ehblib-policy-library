**SIGN POLICY **

E. H. Butler Library

1.  H. Butler Library has a professionally designed signage system.

The following guidelines have been established to accommodate those design principles.

**A. ADDITIONAL, REPLACEMENT OR TEMPORARY SIGNAGE**

1.  Additional or replacement signs in any area should be produced in the assigned

quadrant color. (as close to that color as possible - the four colors are red, green,

light blue and yellow)

1.  When temporary signage is needed for emergency or special occasions, a

computer produced sign should be used.

1.  Temporary signs should be dated when signs are hung.

2.  Temporary signs **should be removed when no longer needed.**

1.  **NO HAND WRITTEN SIGNS ARE ALLOWED, UNLESS THERE IS AN**

**URGENT NEED.**

1.  Department Heads will be responsible for taping over incorrect information on

permanent signs with color-coordinated tape or paper. These signs will be corrected

as soon as possible or within budgetary time-lines.

1.  Department heads are to be consulted and advised of any special project signage

that is to be hung on a temporary basis in their areas.

1.  **NO SIGNS SHOULD BE ATTACHED TO THE HANGING SERVICE IDENTIFICATION SIGNS.**

No signs should be attached with tape on directional or room signs as well.

Scotch tape ruins the finish on the signs.

1.  Un-authorized signs placed on walls and in the corridors, quadrants or restrooms,

etc. will be removed.
