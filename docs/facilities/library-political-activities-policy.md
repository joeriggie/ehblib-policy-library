Political Activities involving State Employees
Federal Election Law and New York State Law regarding political activities provides:

-   No employee is to conduct political activities on paid state time.

-   A state employee may participate in an election as a candidate and, if elected, serve in the office, provided such service will not interfere with state duties or create a conflict of interest.

-   A state employee may engage in political activities in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for elected office or a political issue, provided such activities do not interfere with state duties and provided the employee does not associate political activities with his or her official position or state affiliation.

-   State equipment, vehicles, and office space are to be used only for official state business.

-   State employees may not use their official positions to procure either campaign contributions or volunteer assistance.

-   No appointments, promotions, demotions, or salary increases are to be made on the basis of political affiliation.

The above provisions also pertain to individuals employed by the state whose salary is financed in whole or in part by any federal loan or grant.

Questions on the above may be referred to Susan Earshen, director of human resource management, at ext. 3042.
