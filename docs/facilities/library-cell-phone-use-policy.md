Butler Library is aware of the need to “stay in touch.” However, ringing cell phones and personal phone conversations can be distracting and disturbing to others. Therefore, the following policy is effective immediately:

-   Library patrons should make and receive all calls in the Main Lobby of the library only.

-   Library patrons should use the silent signal function as the alert for incoming calls.

-   Library patrons who do not have a silent signal function should turn the audible signal to the lowest volume. When receiving an incoming call, patrons should answer the call and ask the caller to wait until he or she can move to the Main Lobby before continuing the conversation.
