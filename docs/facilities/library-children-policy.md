E. H. Butler Library

College

E. H. Butler Library welcomes patrons of all ages. However, concern for the safety and well-being of children as well as proper stewardship of library resources prompts the following:

-   A child is defined as anyone who appears to be under the age of sixteen.

-   A responsible adult must accompany children in the library at all times. The presence of unaccompanied children will be reported to University Police.

-   A child who is disruptive, uses library resources inappropriately, or damages library materials or equipment, will be reported to University Police.

-   Butler Library computers are intended for the use of students, faculty and staff. Adults may not log children in to use the computers because the computers do not have content filters. Children may use Catalog Lookup computers to consult the library catalog.

Library staff members are not expected to act as police officers nor are they expected to search for accompanying adults or determine the ages of children. Any problems at all will be reported to University Police.
