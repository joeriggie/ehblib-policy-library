Purpose of the System
=====================

-   DETERANT

    -   Strategically located and highly visible cameras show the public that the area is under surveillance.

    -   The pictures that are displayed on the TV in the lobby also give the surveillance message to the public.

<!-- -->

-   INVESTIGATION - Replaying the recorded images can help University Police identify persons in the area of the camera at a given time or may even show a person in the act of committing a violation

-   EVIDENCE – University Police can take the PC to court to be used as evidence against a violator

Procedures for managing the equipment
=====================================

-   Cameras – library staff have no responsibility for the cameras

-   TV – both must be turned ON all the time or all the time that the library is open
