**SIGN POLICY**

E. H. Butler Library

Buffalo State College

E. H. Butler Library has a professionally designed signage system. The following guidelines have been established to accommodate those design principles already in place and to insure library signs provide information and direction to patrons in an attractive, uniform, and clear manner. A designated sign-maker for the library will be appointed and all requests for signs will be directed to this person. Effective February 26, 2003, the designated sign-maker for E. H. Butler Library will be John Turnwall.

There are two types of signage in Butler Library:

• Professionally made signs such as hanging service identification signs, office and room signs, and floor plan signs should not be changed or altered without approval of the Director's Office. Office signs must be ADA compliant and will be produced by the designated sign-maker of the library. Requests for changes to these signs can be e-mailed to the Director's Office.

• Additional, replacement or temporary signs must be made by the designated sign-maker. All requests for these signs should be referred to Department Heads who will approve and forward them to the sign-maker.

All signs will incorporate the following standards:

Uniformity:

In an effort to have neat, consistent and clear signage throughout the library, all additional, replacement or temporary signs will follow a uniform template. All signs will have a standard font, color, and design, and will be free of graphics. All signs will be laminated and posted appropriately. Signs may be informational (such as stack end labels, hours signs, etc.) or directional (restrooms, elevator, etc.) and must be dated and computer produced. Hand-written signs will be used only in emergencies. All inappropriate signs will be removed immediately.

Color:

Each quadrant of the library has been assigned a designated color. There are four designated colors: red, green, light blue, and yellow. See attachment for quadrant color assignments. All additional, replacement, or temporary signs must comply with the color assignment of that particular area or quadrant of the library.

Font:

One standard font will be used for all custom-made signage in the library.

Size:

All stack-end labels for all shelving units in all areas of the library will be a standard size to be determined by the designated sign-maker. All informational and directional signs will be either 81/2 x 11 or 11 x 17 as determined by the designated sign-maker. Any other sizes must be approved by the Director's Office.

Design:

All signs will be of standard design as determined by the library sign maker. Unless otherwise indicated, graphics will no be used on standard library signs. A posting date will be indicated on all signs.

Special Signs:

All signs advising of a special project or event in the library must be approved by the Director's Office and should comply with the above guidelines. The designated sign-maker will work with individuals to produce appropriate signs for special projects. Exceptions can be made to the guidelines for special signs with prior approval of the Director's Office.

Lobby Kiosk signs:

Signs to be posted on the kiosk in the library lobby must be approved by a library staff member who must initial and date the sign prior to posting.

Vending room signs:

The bulletin board in the vending room is available for advertising college-sponsored or student-related activities. All materials will be removed at the discretion of the library staff.

Exhibit signs:

All library exhibits must be signed with the following information:

Name of exhibit, author of exhibit, organization, contact information, inclusive dates of exhibit.

Unauthorized, inappropriate, damaged, out-dated, or incorrectly posted signs will be removed.
