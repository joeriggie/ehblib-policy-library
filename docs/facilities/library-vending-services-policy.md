**E. H. Butler Library**

**Buffalo State College (SUNY)**

Vending services were established in Room 129 of E. H. Butler Library in December 1997. The vending machines were provided and maintained by the Faculty Student Association (FSA). The facility is available to the public during published library hours.

In January of 2000 the FSA contract with the college was ended. Personal Touch Food Service, Inc. got the new college contract to vend snacks and hot beverages. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. got the contract to vend cold beverages. Both vendors now supply and maintain the vending machines in BL 129, generally three times per week. In addition, Personal Touch supplies and maintains the Change Machine. It provides coins for one dollar or five dollar bills.

SERVICE FOR FAULTY VENDING MACHINES
===================================

Signs are posted in the Vending Services Room directing patrons to report all problems (except loss of money) directly to the vendor. The signs include the vendorsâ€™ names and telephone numbers.

If a library staff member notices a problem, he or she should report it to the Associate Director who will notify the vendor. The staff member or the Associate Director will post an Out of Service sign if appropriate.
