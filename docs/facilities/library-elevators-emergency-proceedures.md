In the event of an un-scheduled power outage, library staff members should take the following steps with respect to the elevators:

1.  Immediately check the public elevator (floors 1, 2, and 3) to find out if anyone is trapped. University Police Student Assistants (UPSA) have also been directed to do this, but UPSA schedules change and it is possible that no UPSA is available. DO NOT ASSUME THAT A UPSA HAS CHECKED.

2.  Check the staff elevator (floors 1, 2 and 3) to find out if anyone is trapped. UPSAs have been directed to check floors 2 and 3, but do not assume that a UPSA has checked.

3.  If anyone is trapped, immediately call the University Police Department at 6333.

4.  Advise the trapped person(s) to stay calm, wait until help arrives, and *NOT TO* FORCE DOORS OPEN OR CLIMB OUT OF THE ELEVATOR. Should power be restored as a person was climbing out of the elevator, he or she could be killed.

5.  Keep talking to the person(s) in the elevator to reassure them that they will be rescued, and that they have not been abandoned.

Anyone trapped in an elevator during an un-scheduled power outage should be aware of the following:

1.  An elevator CANNOT FALL because of a power failure. The elevator is automatically held in place by hydraulic pressure—a mechanical function—not by electrical power.

2.  There will be emergency light inside the elevator because the light is connected to the emergency generator.

3.  Trapped person(s) will not suffocate. Air continues to circulate in the elevator.

4.  Staff will be checking the elevators so shouts from trapped person(s) will be heard.

5.  Freeing persons trapped in elevators during a power outage has the highest priority for the University Police Department and for Campus Services.

*Elevator Control Panel* – see also next sheet

1.  Normally, a loud signal will sound if the **Alarm** button at the bottom of the control panel is pressed. This button IS NOT connected to the emergency generator, so it will not sound during a power outage.

2.  Normally, pressing the **Call for Help** button at the bottom of the control panel will send a signal to University Police, and the red **Call Is Being Placed** light will illuminate followed by the **Help Is on the Way** green light. This system is in place for persons who cannot hear or speak. This button IS NOT connected to the emergency generator, so it will not send the signal during a power outage.

3.  Normally, one would hear someone speaking from the University Police Department and be able to answer that person through the speaker at the bottom of the control panel (sometimes called the “telephone”). This system is also NOT connected to the emergency generator, so it will not function during a power outage.

Therefore, it is extremely important that the person(s) in the elevator remain calm so that he or she (they) can hear when someone calls from outside the elevator.
