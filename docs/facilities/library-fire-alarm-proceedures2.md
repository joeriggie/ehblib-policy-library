**Procedures in the Event a Fire Alarm Sounds**

E. H. Butler Library
====================

**Buffalo State College (SUNY)**

Whenever a fire alarm sounds (regardless of whether it is a scheduled drill, a false alarm, or an actual emergency), everyone in the library, including library staff, must:

-   Vacate the building via the nearest safe exit

-   Encourage everyone in the area to vacate also – staff are not responsible for clearing the building, but making sure that everyone within sight moves out is expected

-   Close doors as you exit (closed fire doors prevent the spread of fire and smoke)

-   Do not lock doors unless there is specific reason to do so

-   Do not re-enter the building until notified by the Fire Department that it is safe to do so

CIRCULATION SERVICES STAFF – If it is safe to do so,
----------------------------------------------------

-   Lock the cash drawer

-   Lock the Circulation area

-   Shut off the Front Door sensors and slide all doors to the open position

-   Encourage patrons to exit quickly using all doors, including emergency exits; security of library materials is disregarded in emergency situations

-   Use Public Safety Aides to assist

OTHER PUBLIC SERVICES STAFF
---------------------------

-   Encourage everyone in the area to vacate the building using all exit doors

-   Lock the area if appropriate

-   Classrooms with classes in session must also be evacuated

-   Lock the area if appropriate/necessary

SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
---------------------

-   If you happen to be on the second or third floor when an alarm sounds, and are aware of the presence of a disabled person, immediately escort that person to the elevator, accompany them to the ground floor, and exit

-   If you are aware that a disabled patron is upstairs or in a Special Services Room notify University Police or a fire fighter of the location of that person as you exit
