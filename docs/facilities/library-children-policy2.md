E. H. Butler Library

Buffalo State College

E. H. Butler Library welcomes patrons of all ages. However, concerns for the safety and well-being of children who appear to be under the age of sixteen prompts the following policy:

-   A responsible adult must accompany children in the library at all times

    -   The presence of unaccompanied children who appear to be under the age of thirteen may be reported to University Police by library staff.

    -   Unaccompanied children who appear to be thirteen to fifteen years old may be asked by library staff to leave the building.

-   If a child is disruptive (noisy, running, using library resources inappropriately) or damages library materials or equipment, a library staff member may report the situation to University Police.

-   Butler Library computers are intended for the use of Buffalo State students, faculty and staff. Children, accompanied by a responsible adult, may use Express Computers to consult the catalog or other information resources. Children may not monopolize a station to Web surf, send instant messages, e-mail, play games, etc. and those found doing so may be asked to vacate the station by library staff.

Library staff members are not expected to act as police officers nor are they expected to search for accompanying adults or determine the ages of children. Any problems at all should be reported to University Police or reported to University Police Student Assistants (UPSA).
