*This Part of the Butler Library Security System Has Four Components*:

-   Eight video *cameras*: six in CyberQuad (1 - main corridor, 2 - BL 318, 3 - BL 316, 4 - BL 314, 5 -BL 310 and 6 - service corridor) and two in the Lobby

-   One television *monitor* (TV): behind the Front Desk used to view images transmitted by the cameras and to playback videotape

-   One *videocassette recorder* (VCR): simultaneously tapes all eight images transmitted by the cameras

-   One *multiplexer*: coordinates the eight signals transmitted by the cameras; permits viewing one image, multiple images, and sequenced images and also recording of all images which can be played back as one image, multiple images, and sequenced images.

The TV, VCR and Multiplexer are kept behind the Front Desk in a mobile cart that has a lockable cabinet. A cart is used in case there is a need to playback tapes in the library and one wants to move to another location to do so. One of the keys to the cabinet is kept in the library vault in BL 133.

Purpose of the System
=====================

-   DETERANT

    -   Strategically located and highly visible cameras show the public that the area is under surveillance.

    -   The pictures that are displayed on the TV in the lobby also give the surveillance message to the public.
