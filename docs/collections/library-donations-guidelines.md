**SUNY responses – Discarded Material**

**SUNY ACC**

At ACC we use a variety of methods.

 

In general we are continually weeding and put the discarded items out on a book cart for our patrons to take if they wish.  If the items linger too long they end up in the trash.

 

I contacted Better World books when we were doing a more concerted weeding of reference, and not to discourage you from using Better World, but they did indicated they would be selective with reference titles.  However they would provide a scanner for ISBNS to match with their list of wanted/acceptable items.

 

I recently listed our entire NY Times microfilm collection on NYLINE and found a small research library willing to take the items, with them arranging shipping.  I also advertised some law books in the county bar association newsletter and had interest.

**ESF**

We also use BWB, but it’s sometimes easier and more efficient to offer the discards to students for free. Stuff that neither BWB, nor the campus community has interest in is shredded and recycled into bedding for farm animals.

We don’t have a strict or written policy for weeding and discards.

**Cayuga**

**How do you discard your unwanted books/materials?**

If we were doing a large weeding, we would use Better World Books. If it is a few at a time, we put them on our “freebie” cart outside the library.  

 

**Do you use a company? If so, which one? **

Better World Books for large weeding projects.

 

 **Is there a contract required for this service?**

 I think you only sign an agreement with them.

 

**Is there a cost for this service?**

No, that’s the best part. They even provide the shipping tape.

 

 **How are items packaged for pick-up?   **

They provide the boxes and shipping tape. When you have enough boxes, the will either arrange to pick up the materials, or provide UPS shipping labels.  

**How often is pick-up?**

 When you have enough boxes. I think the minimum is 10. 

**Does your institution/library have a policy regarding discarding of materials? If so, could or would you share it?**

Nothing Written.

**Clinton**

Our rules are similar at Clinton CC.  We are not permitted to sell or give away discarded library items because they were purchased with county funds.  We can offer them to other county agencies but the inquiry process is time-consuming so we seldom do it; one exception--we gave our old entertainment videos to our county advocacy resource center (ARC). 

**Delhi**

**How do you discard your unwanted books/materials? **

Through periodic weeding (we tend to rotate subject areas), withdrawn materials are designated for offering to other libraries (mostly runs of periodicals), Better World Books, or the "Free Shelves" that anyone can take from.  We advertise the Free Books a couple of times a year and it's a big hit. 

 

**Do you use a company? If so, which one? **

Better World Books.  We get a tiny bit of money in return, and they provide boxes and pay for shipping.  We used to sell the books to local bookseller (by the pound), but it was a lot of work.  Before that, we chopped the spine off and recycled the paper (also a TON of work, no pun intended).  And dangerous for the poor students who were sent to the basement to chop books.

 

**Is there a contract required for this service? **

  No contract.

 

**Is there a cost for this service? **

  No cost for BWB, we actually see a small check every couple of months.

 

**How are items packaged for pick-up?   **

  For BWB, they provide boxes and pay for shipping.

 

**How often is pick-up? **

 Whenever we call them.

 

**Does your institution /library have a policy regarding discarding of material s? If so, could or would you share it? **

It's more a procedure than policy. I'm at home, so can't pull it up for you.  We do have a gifts policy that states we'll do whatever we want with the gift once we accept it.

**Jefferson Community College**

**How do you discard your unwanted books/materials?**

We use better World Books
**Do you use a company? If so, which one?**
See above
**Is there a contract required for this service?**
I wouldn’t call it a contract – we have an account with them
**Is there a cost for this service?**
No, they make money selling our discards. We actually are credited  a small percentage for some of the sales they make. Since we can’t actually sell our books this pittance is made into a credit on our Alibris account
**How are items packaged for pick-up?  **
We request boxes when we are ready to send a shipment – they send them for free. We use the Better World Books website to arrange a UPS pickup and we pay nothing
**How often is pick-up?**

As often as we need. I think there is a minimum of 6 boxes per shipment
**Does your institution/library have a policy regarding discarding of materials? If so, could or would you share it?**
Deselection or weeding of the collection:

The Library has a regular schedule of deselection, or weeding of library materials in concert with the annual inventory procedure. Deselection is necessary to provide space for new material, and to cultivate an up-to-date, relevant collection, providing students with accurate and timely information.

Published material is examined and chosen for deselection based on one or more of the following criteria:

-   Out of date or inaccurate information

-   Multiple copies of same edition

-   Newer edition available

-   Badly worn or damaged items

-   Discontinued curriculum

-   Pattern of use

-   Lack of significance in the literature of the discipline

-   Appropriateness for the community college user

Faculty members are encouraged to participate in the deselection process for their respective discipline. Deselected material is sent to Better World Books or another agency that makes use of pre-owned books by promoting reuse or recycling. Material not accepted by such an agency is recycled by college facility employees in an appropriate manner. The Library does not sell or give away deselected material.

**Monroe**

**How do you discard your unwanted books/materials?**

We weed regularly and place discards in one of four places: 1 – we have a give-away table 2 – we offer large ranges of reference materials on local listservs 3 – we use Better World Books for items worth re-selling 4 – we call facilities for an extra large recycling bin (yes, we have extra large recycling bins but they have to bring them over – they have wheels!)  

**Do you use a company? If so, which one? **

  Better World Books

**Is there a contract required for this service?**

 We have an account with them. 

**Is there a cost for this service?**

 No

 **How are items packaged for pick-up?   **

 UPS – they send a shipping label

 **How often is pick-up?**

  Whenever we arrange a shipment

**Does your institution/library have a policy regarding discarding of materials? If so, could or would you share it?**

  We weed regularly which results in the necessary disposal of out-of-date or damaged materials.  Our guidelines comply with College Policy regarding disposition of damaged and out-of-date materials and equipment.

**Nassau**

At Nassau we are not permitted to sell or give away discarded items.  I have always been told that following county procurement rules, items no longer needed must either be discarded or sent out to bid for resale by our Procurement Department.  There is no separate set of rules for the college library.
 
**Potsdam**

**How do you discard your unwanted books/materials?**

We have a contract with the owner of a local used bookstore; he picks up what he wants of our discards and returns a small percentage of his profits to us.  The rest go to Better World Books.

**Do you use a company? If so, which one?**

 See above.

**Is there a contract required for this service?**

 We had our Purchasing and Payables office draft a contract for our local bookseller, for the benefit of any auditor interested in dotted i's and crossed t's.
 

**Is there a cost for this service?**

The benefit of BWB, which others have mentioned, is that they pay for boxes and shipping.  This reduces our involvement to staff-time-only, which matters to us.

 

 **Does your institution/library have a policy regarding discarding of materials? If so, could or would you share it?**

In the ideal world, we weed to the same criteria we purchase; if we wouldn't buy it, should we keep it?  This is worked into our collection development policy.  Our gift policy also indicates our acceptance of donations is dependent on the donor acknowledging that we'll do whatever we want with the item.  <http://wwwx.potsdam.edu/library/Coll_Dev_Policy_2004_main.htm>

As for declaring something surplus, the community colleges may be operating in a different set of rules, but I operate under the following guidance, from SUNY counsel's Joanne Fazioli, via Carey Hatch in 2003:

"Chapter 122 of the Laws of 1992 (new subsection six of Section 178 of State Finance Law) allows campuses to dispose of library books or journals after the department head certifies they are no longer needed. While technically a record of each transfer or disposal, along with certification, is to be filed with OGS - I know of no campus filing with OGS nor do I think OGS is looking for such paperwork. My advice is that the campus maintain any disposal records for an audit trail - that books/journals may be used as trade-in, donated to another entity(school district), dumped/recycled or sold for such nominal income as maybe generated. The campus must collect sales tax and deposit revenue to appropriate account or transmit to General Fund based on source of funds of the original purchase(ie., State approp - General Fund; IFR - IFR account) "

**Sullivan **

**How do you discard your unwanted books/materials?** 

We recycle a large portion of our books.  This requires cutting the bindings off hardbacks and bundling the text blocks with twine (to satisfy the requirements of the paper recycling company). 

We also have an account with Better World Books.

 

**Do you use a company? If so, which one? ** 

Better World Books.

 

**Is there a contract required for this service?** 

There is some sort of written agreement, but I don't recall the details.  There's no expense for the library.  Moreover, academic libraries don't have to prescreen the books they send to BWB. 

 

**Is there a cost for this service?**

No.  BWB supplies boxes and pays for shipping.  You receive a commission for any of your books that they sell.

 

**How are items packaged for pick-up?   ** 

You fill the boxes that they provide. 

 

**How often is pick-up?** 

Whenever you've filled a certain number of boxes--ten, I think. 

 

**Does your institution/library have a policy regarding discarding of materials? If so, could or would you share it?** 

1.  **Deselection:** Periodic weeding of the collections will be performed based on several criteria including: (1) outdated or inaccurate content, (2) lack of relevance to current academic programs, (3) worn or mutilated volumes, (4) outdated editions of a work, (5) lack of circulation and (6) multiple copies of a work when there is no longer adequate need. Materials must never be weeded on the basis of partisan or doctrinal disapproval. Where necessary, replacement copies or more current materials will be purchased to replace weeded resources.
