**135. Public Access to
of Policy Handbook, No. 130 (Revised Edition 1981)**

It has been the policy of the for some time that the general public be given access to University libraries insofar as possible. Some campuses are presently able to provide such access in varying forms. It should also be noted that public access to the collections is also available through interlibrary loan (including the New York State Inter-Library Loan \[NYSILL\] network), through the Regional Reference and Research (3R's) Systems, and through local cooperative arrangements with other institutions.

Broader implementation of a policy of public access has fiscal and administrative implications which must be carefully considered before new regulations can be issued. Pending further guidelines, campuses may extend the facilities of their libraries to the general public, whenever it can be done, in a manner that is both fiscally sound and consistent with this primary educational mission.
