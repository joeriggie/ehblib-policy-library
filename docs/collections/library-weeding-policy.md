Weeding Policy

Materials are purchased with consideration of their long-term value to the collection. The value of a work, however, changes over time. While many works retain their value to the curriculum, when considered against the whole of a subject or area of knowledge, some works will age and need to be replaced by newer research. The same considerations involved in selecting an item for acquisition will be used in considering an item for withdrawal. We retain items that do not reflect current scholarship or the current needs of the curriculum if the item is classic scholarship. Whenever possible, weeding will be done as a collaborative effort between the liaison librarians and subject specialists from the relevant departments.

**Weeding Process**

Weeding or de-selection the removal of materials to be discarded, is an important part of the total collection development process. Building a viable collection of materials to serve the college is a dynamic process that includes assessment and the removal of materials that are obsolete, damaged beyond repair, or n longer relevant to the curriculum or not central to cooperative collection agreements.

**Guidelines for Weeding Print and Non-Print Collections**

-   The following categories of materials will be considered for weeding from the collection.

1.  Outdated materials.

2.  Superseded editions.

3.  Excessively worn or damaged materials. Items in poor condition, but still valuable in terms of intellectual content will be considered for repair or replacement.

4.  Multiple copies of monographs which are no longer needed to support the curriculum.

5.  Textbooks and instructional materials or previous editions of more recent texts.

6.  Technologies widely considered to be obsolete, such as audio cassettes, 8 track tapes, phono-records and slides.

    -   Whenever possible, monographs initially chosen for discard will be checked against standard bibliographies (e.g., Books for College Libraries) before being discarded.

    -   Whenever possible the preservation of historically relevant audio or visual materials should be addressed with digitally reformatted materials.

    -   Faculty representatives will also be asked to review potential discards in their subject area(s) whenever Library staff is uncertain about the value of materials.

    -   All materials designated for withdrawal will be reviewed by the Collection Development area.

**Weeding Criteria**

For specific weeding criteria, we cite: Slote, Stanley J. *Weeding library collections: Library Weeding Methods*. (latest edition). Englewood, CO: Libraries Unlimited, in particular:

-   Weeding based upon appearance or condition

-   Weeding of superfluous or duplicate volumes

-   Weeding based upon poor content

-   Specific classes of work with specific ages for weeding

**Disposition of Weeded Materials**

Disposition of weeded materials will be made in accordance with Chapter 122, Subsection Six of Section 178 of State Finance Law, of New York state. This law allows campuses to dispose of library books or journals after the department head certifies they are no longer needed. A record of each transfer or disposal, along with certification, is to be filed with OGS. The library should maintain any disposal records for an audit trail.
