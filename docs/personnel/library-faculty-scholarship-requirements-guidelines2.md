RE: Scholarly Ability and Accomplishment

The following statement on scholarly ability and accomplishment by academic librarians was approved by the faculty of E. H. Butler Library on April 19, 2005.

Scholarship or scholarly accomplishment by an academic librarian is indicated by evidence of high-level contributions to the profession of librarianship, rather than by a body of research as may be characteristic of other academics. The academic librarian should be in the vanguard of the art and the science of librarianship, evidencing scholarship, creativity, and innovativeness, as well as an appreciation of the best of traditionalism, along with strong support of the research and instructional missions of the institution.

In the traditional academic setting, scholarly ability is usually evidenced via refereed published research which serves to increase the body of knowledge in a specific discipline. In librarianship, those traditional vehicles of scholarship are most commonly followed by library school faculty who possess a Ph.D. in the field and whose work situations parallel those of professorial faculty in the other disciplines. Although practicing librarians usually have limited opportunities to engage in pure research, they can and do make significant scholarly contributions to librarianship through a variety of activities, in a variety of media. For example: publication of books, articles, indexes, reviews, etc.; writing or editorial activity; papers, poster sessions, and other presentations given at professional and/or scholarly conferences; panel participation; invited lectures or class presentations; demonstrations of computer searching and strategies; design and production of World Wide Web sites, pages, documents and Web-based instructional videos; creative use and development of electronic course management software; offices or other significant participation in scholarly or professional organizations; consulting work; grants obtained; innovative collection development; significant applied research accomplished; scholarship of teaching and learning, including information literacy, curriculum development and assessment; contributions to the arts, such as concerts and exhibits; production of media programs; and systems analysis and development of computer applications and programs, such as digital asset management and digital preservation, and patron and bibliographic database management and standardization. Administrative documents and work products in the form of print, audiovisual, or electronic reports, handbooks, manuals, and similar items may be considered in this category if they present innovative ideas or incorporate research.

It is important to recognize that different expressions of scholarly activity may be appropriate for librarians according to their academic backgrounds, intellectual interests, and professional specialties. In these circumstances, contributions outside of librarianship are explicitly recognized as appropriate endeavors in the realm of scholarly accomplishments. The resulting publications, documents, productions, etc., should either make significant contributions to the institutional mission of Buffalo State College, or be of regional, national, or international importance. Because quantitative limitations are imposed by the nature of a librarianâ€™s professional obligations (i.e., a 12-month year consisting of structured work days spent largely on internal library responsibilities), evaluation should be primarily qualitative.

It is clear that no individual will be required to evidence superior performance in every area mentioned herein. These criteria are intended to be guidelines, not prescriptions.
