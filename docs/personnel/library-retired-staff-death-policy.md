Policy of Remembrance upon the Death of Retired Members

of E. H. Butler Library

The Library Administrative Board has requested that the Director’s Office coordinate the solicitation of donations in remembrance of retired employees who have passed away. The money collected will be used to purchase books in honor of our colleague. A book plate will be inserted with the name of the employee and his/her years of service at E. H. Butler Library. Acquisitions Services will record the titles purchased and a letter of condolence will be sent from the Director’s Office indicating that our staff has remembered and honored the individual in this way. The title of the book(s) will be listed in the letter.
