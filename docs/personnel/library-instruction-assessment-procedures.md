Assessment Procedures

Library Instruction

E. H. Butler Library

Fall 2004

There are three library instruction assessment tools at present: one for course-related library instruction, one for Library 100, and one for Library 300 (the same as that for Library 300).

**Course related library instruction assessment:**

Copies of the course-related library instruction assessment will be kept in the handout area near the mailboxes. Librarians can help themselves to copies for their classes. For this semester, librarians do not need to put their names on the assessments. All that is needed is the course name and number. After the class, put the assessment tools in Amyâ€™s mailbox. I will then tally them and put them in one of the drawers of the file cabinet in our mailroom across from our handouts.

**Library 100/300 course assessment:**

Copies of the library 100 and 300 course assessment will be given to the librarians teaching these courses. The assessment tool can be used as a pre- and post-test for library 100 and 300. If you are using it as a pre- and post-test, please put them in my mailbox after administering them. They will also be stored in the mailroom filing cabinet.

Please note that the use of these assessment tools is required for every library instruction course taught during the fall 2004 semester. We will re-evaluate these tools and procedures before the start of the spring 2005 semester.
