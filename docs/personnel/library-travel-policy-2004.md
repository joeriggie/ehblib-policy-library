**E. H. Butler Library **

**Staff Development, Training and Travel Policy**

*This policy has been developed after examination of the "Draft - Travel Policy‚Äù (March 1996 Hill/Riess/Vaughan) issued by the Library Faculty.*

Any staff member:

1.  Presenting at a national, state or regional conference will be supported in full. A written report to be shared with staff is required. A staff presentation is encouraged.

2.  Attending a national, state or regional conference will receive 2/3 support. A written report to be shared with staff is required. A staff presentation is encouraged. (Limit: one per year.)

3.  Attending a local conference:

1st conference per fiscal year - full registration

2nd conference per fiscal year - 1/2 registration

(Subsequent conferences are full responsibility of staff member)

1.  Serving as an elected or appointed representative on a college-related national or state committee will be fully supported (e.g., or SUNYLA or FACT)

2.  Attending a training session at the request of the college or library administration will receive full support. A written report to be shared with staff is required. A staff presentation may also be required to share the newly acquired skills.

3.  Attending a training session that is library-related will be supported for those who choose training over a conference. Other training activities may be supported as budget allows. A staff presentation will be required to share the newly acquired skills.

Staff are encouraged to consider other sources of funding. The money to support this new policy is coming from the library budget. Reductions in other areas allow the reinvestment in our staff. Grants, scholarships, (WNYLRC, SUNYLA) etc. should be fully investigated before tapping these funds.
