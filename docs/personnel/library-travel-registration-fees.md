Registration fees for conferences, meetings, etc. should be submitted to the Accounting Office for processing, and no later than three weeks prior to the registration deadline. If there are other travel expenses in addition to the registration fee, send the completed registration form, travel authorization with all approval signatures, account number to be charged, and documentation pertaining to what, if any, meals are included in the registration fee. Be sure to check the registration fee pre-payment box on the travel authorization and provide the Federal ID number of the payee.
If the registration is for a one-day and/or local event and there are no other travel expenses involved, then you may submit the completed registration form along with a completed pink requisition and attach the required documentation mentioned above. Be sure to include the Federal ID number of the payee.
If an employee chooses to pay for a registration fee with their personal funds, they may do so, but they will not be reimbursed until after the event takes place. They can submit their reimbursement request on a travel voucher along with the original receipt and the required documentation
