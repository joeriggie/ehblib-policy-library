INTRODUCTION
------------

Librarians play a large role in the promotion of information literacy on campus, and much of this is through two distinct types of instruction we offer. One type of instruction is referred to as course-related library instruction. This involves an invitation by a professor to serve as guest lecturer to the class, teaching students library research skills and how to use library resources. The other type of instruction involves the teaching of a credit-bearing course in library research methods (LIB 100 or LIB 300).

GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF STUDENT, PEER, AND DEPT. HEAD INPUT

The reference department head and the personnel committee recommendations must evaluate evidence of effective teaching that is presented in the personnel package or file materials. To facilitate this review, the personnel committee should prepare a summary report based on the following:

1.  **Student evaluation of teaching**

> Student comments should include all those collected by the reference department. Alumni comments are appropriate for promotion to associate and full librarian and for continuing appointment.

-   Evaluations for course-related library instruction are not necessary; however, teaching librarians may suggest faculty put a question in their own evaluations regarding library instruction.

<!-- -->

-   Evaluations are expected from the entire class for each section of LIB 100 or LIB 300 that is taught.

<!-- -->

-   The personnel committee and reference department head must do a critical analysis of data to identify the candidate’s strengths and limitations.

1.  Peer (librarians and/or other faculty) and department head evaluation of teaching (file must provide explanation of how peer evaluation was included)

-   Peer visitation of classes (course-related or credit-bearing classes) and written feedback.

<!-- -->

-   Peer evaluation of items listed under item (3).

<!-- -->

-   Application of consistent department procedures for peer review.

1.  **Additional evidence of effective teaching**

> The additional evidence that should be provided by candidates and examined by the personnel committee and the reference department head ***can*** include the following kinds of documentation of effective teaching:

-   A reflective statement of the librarian’s contribution t the teaching mission of the library or college.

<!-- -->

-   Course Syllabi which detail course content, objectives, teaching methods, readings, student assignments, etc.

<!-- -->

-   Evidence of curricular revision and updating.

<!-- -->

-   Evidence of attendance at faculty development workshops that enhance teaching content, methodologies, or newer technologies.

<!-- -->

-   Success of alumni / alumni surveys.

<!-- -->

-   Creation of learning materials and aids.

<!-- -->

-   Added efforts to support student learning.

<!-- -->

-   Other

These are just suggestions for additional evidence of effective teaching. Teaching librarians are neither limited to these suggestions nor are they expected to implement all of them.
