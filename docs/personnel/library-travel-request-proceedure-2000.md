1.  First ask Maryruth for funds. I would like *you* to let me know if it is approved.

2.  I need to know if travel money is coming from the travel account *or* a foundation account.

3.  If money is being provided from the travel account, I have to submit a Travel Authorization form ***before*** you go.

4.  Also, if you need an advance for meals and hotel this can be done before you go.

5.  If you need airline or train reservations, please go through the Director's Office since they can be booked through a travel agent and tickets can be sent to our Accounting Office for easy pickup.

6.  If known far enough in advance, registration for a conference can be paid ahead of time or we can request an advance for this from a foundation account.

7.  I also have a simple form for you to take with you when you travel to show what you need to provide me with.

8.  We also have tax exempt forms for you to take with you if you travel in New York State since you are not reimbursed for state tax paid on a room.

9.  Once you have traveled I need to fill out a Travel Voucher. You will need to provide me with receipts and a brochure or some form of paperwork to show the purpose of your travel.

10. If money is being provided from a foundation account, forms can be submitted after you travel.

11. If you are attending a local conference, registration can be done easily in advance with a pink requisition form.

The above are a few of some simple instructions to follow. This will help to make your travel easier and sometimes not so costly. Please ask if you have any questions regarding travel or conferences.
