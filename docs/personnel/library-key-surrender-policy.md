When an employee of E. H. Butler Library leaves his/her position in the library (retirement, resignation, dismissal, etc.), he/she is expected to surrender all college keys in his/her possession. Upon notice of separation supervisors should call Campus Services (6111) to request a list of keys issued to that employee. Once keys are surrendered, receipts should be issued to the employee. Copies of key surrender receipts should be kept in the former employee’s file in the Director’s Office.

-   BUILDING KEYS

<!-- -->

-   Building keys may be surrendered to Campus Services in the Clinton Center. The separating employee will be issued a receipt. The employee should give a copy of the receipt to the supervisor.

-   If it is not possible for the employee to surrender keys to Campus Services in the Clinton Center, keys should be surrendered to the immediate supervisor.

-   The supervisor will return the keys to Campus Services in the Clinton Center and be issued a receipt. The supervisor will retain a copy of the receipt. The original receipt will be mailed to the former employee.

<!-- -->

-   DESK, FILE CABINET, EQUIPMENT AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS KEYS

> All such keys should be surrendered to Campus Services or to the immediate supervisor.

-   SUNYCARDs (Employee Identification Cards)

> In some instances the employee identification card has been encoded to act as a key card. Supervisors should notify the administrator of the appropriate database to delete that key card from access to any campus locks.
>
> Supervisors should notify Circulation Services that an employee is leaving. Circulation should check to see if that employee has any outstanding library materials and recall them. Once the circulation record is cleared, the employee should be deleted from the patron database or the patron type should be changed.
>
> Supervisors should ask for the surrender of the SUNYCard itself. Former employees should not represent themselves as current employees by presentation of a SUNYCard.
>
> EXCEPTION: Supervisors should advise retiring faculty that they may apply at Circulation Services for a special identification card designating them as having emeritus status.

-   HANDICAPPED PATRON DOOR KEY CARD

> Supervisors should ask for the surrender of key cards that permit use of the special library door intended for use by handicapped patrons.
