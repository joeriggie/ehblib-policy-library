PERSONNEL POLICIES: Use of Leave Accruals
=========================================

All employees of Butler Library (CSEA and UUP) accrue leave credits with the exception of hourly employees. Supervisors are responsible for insuring that leave credits are properly charged on attendance records and time sheets whenever employees do not come to work.

-   ANNUAL LEAVE – Prior approval of supervisors should be sought.

-   SICK LEAVE – Employees must advise supervisors as soon as they know they will be unable to come to work because of illness, etc.

In the event that an employee is on vacation and becomes ill during the course of scheduled annual leave, he or she should charge *annual leave*. However, in this circumstance, supervisors have the discretion to allow an employee to charge sick leave for the duration of the illness if it is appropriately documented.
