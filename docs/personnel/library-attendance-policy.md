LIBRARY FACULTY AND PROFESSIONAL STAFF

At the end of each month you will receive from Human Resource Management (HRM) via Campus Mail a ***UUP Professional Service Record of Attendance***. You are to record chargeable leaves with specific dates and to update the accrual summary. Sign the service record and submit the original to the department head by the end of the third business day of the succeeding month. Retain the copy for your records. If you prefer to retain a **signed** copy of your service record, submit the original and the copy to the department head.

DATES CHARGEABLE
================

-   **VACATION LEAVE** – based on your normal work schedule write the actual dates you did not work a full day in the **Full Days** box. Write the dates you did not work for partial days in the **Partial Days** box, including the fraction of the day you were off. Use the nearest quarter day for reporting partial day absences.

<!-- -->

-   **SICK LEAVE** – based on your normal work schedule write the actual dates you did not work a full day in the appropriate box for **Personal** or for **Family** reasons. Write the dates you did not work for partial days in the appropriate box for **Personal** or for **Family** reasons, supplying the fraction of the day you were off. Use the nearest quarter day for reporting partial day absences.

<!-- -->

-   **COMP TIME** – based on your normal work schedule you will accrue a day of **Comp Time** if you work on a state holiday. If the library is closed for a state holiday on a day that you would normally work, you will also accrue a day. For part time staff if the library is closed for a state holiday when you are *not* normally scheduled to work, you do *not* accrue a holiday. No one may elect to work on holidays when the library is closed.

> Please note in the right margin of the service record the **dates** on which you accrue a holiday and the **dates** on which you actually use the accrued time. Do so even if you think it is obvious and results in no change to the total. This eliminates the need for the department head to check to see if you remembered Election Day.
>
> NOTE: You will also accrue time if you work a significant amount of time beyond your normal obligation. THIS IS NOT REPORTED ON YOUR SERVICE RECORD. You must keep track of this yourself and record use of it as **Comp** on the Reference Desk calendar.
>
> LIBRARY PRACTICE: The term **Comp Time** is used by HRM on the service record to denote **HOLIDAYS**. Generally, in the library we use the term **Holiday Leave** to distinguish it from the time worked beyond the normal schedule which we call **Comp Time**!

ACCRUAL RATES
=============

Rates of accrual vary with length of state service and whether the work obligation is full or part time. Limits on total accruals are set by contract, and it is possible to loose accrued time if limits are exceeded.

DEPARTMENT ATTENDANCE RECORDS
=============================

The Reference Desk calendar is an official record of attendance that has been approved by New York State auditors. It is important that the information recorded there be accurate. The calendar is also an aide to your colleagues who may need to know whether or not you are available. The pages from the calendar are removed each month and stored in the department head’s office.

-   If you anticipate being absent, please record that absence ahead of time on the Reference Desk calendar. Use your initials and indicate the type of leave you are going to charge, e. g.

> AL = Annual Leave
>
> SL = Sick Leave
>
> HL = Holiday Leave
>
> PL = Personal Leave \*
>
> Comp = Comp Time

It is not necessary to record absences when you are not normally scheduled to work.

> Using the word “off” is insufficient for the calendar according to the New York State auditors. You must also note the kind of leave you will charge.

-   If you call to report that you will not be coming to work on a day when you are scheduled to do so, please tell the person taking your call what type of leave you will charge. The person taking the call should note your initials and the type of leave to charge on the calendar.

> If you call at a time when no one is at the Reference Desk, please call **878-5623**. If no one answers within four rings, you will be transferred to voice mail in the Director’s Office. Leave a message. The Director’s secretary will notify the department head and the Reference Desk.

> \* UUP staff do not get Personal Leave, but CSEA staff do.
